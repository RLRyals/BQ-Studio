## Story Concept

### Elevator Pitch
Victorian London, 1885. Celeste Hartwell was already London's most promising young inventor when her killing began—not from malice, but from an obsessive need to understand how things work. Including people. Her father Augustus discovered her dissecting a street urchin in her workshop the same night she was attacked by something in the fog. The vampire curse didn't create the monster; it gave the monster eternity.

The Hartwell Mechanical Gardens is her creation—an underground steampunk wonderland where she's spent fifteen years inventing: automated blood filtration systems that let her feed without killing, probability engines that calculate the perfect mechanical diversions, pneumatic organs that compose endless symphonies. Every room is a new experiment.

When Margot breaks in, Celeste is delighted. Finally, someone clever!

### Core Question
**Can a monster who seeks redemption deserve it?**

### Central Quest
**Mechanical cure for vampirism** - Spanning 5 books with incremental progress and mounting costs

## Market Positioning

### Target Audience
**Primary**: Adult readers (25-45) seeking:
- Dark, complex genre fiction with literary-quality prose
- Morally gray or monstrous protagonists
- Locked-room mysteries and claustrophobic settings
- Intellectual partnerships over romance plots
- Psychological horror and transformation narratives
- Series commitment (not standalone seekers)

**NOT For**:
- Romance readers (no central romance)
- YA crossover (too dark, too complex)
- Mass market thriller fans (too genre-specific, slower pacing)
- Light urban fantasy readers (wrong tone entirely)

### Comparable Titles
- *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue* by V.E. Schwab (immortal protagonist, long quest)
- *Gideon the Ninth* by Tamsyn Muir (locked setting, complex female leads)
- *The Luminous Dead* by Caitlin Starling (claustrophobic tension, morally gray)
- *Mexican Gothic* by Silvia Moreno-Garcia (Gothic horror, isolated setting)
- *Ninth House* by Leigh Bardugo (dark, complex damaged lead)

### Commercial Expectations
**Market Position**: Upper midlist with cult favorite potential

**Sales Expectations**:
- Book 1: 5,000-15,000 copies first year
- Series Total: 30,000-75,000 copies (all 5 books)
- Breakout Scenario: 100,000+ if word-of-mouth ignites

**This Is**:
- Career-establishing serious genre fiction
- Cult favorite series with devoted fanbase
- Literary crossover potential
- Media adaptation candidate (prestige TV)

**This Is NOT**:
- Mass market bestseller play
- Romance crossover title
- YA crossover potential
- Safe commercial bet

## Retrofit Notes

**Context**: This intake form is being backfilled after the project was developed outside the series-architect-2 workflow. The work quality is high, but needs transformation to proper series-architect-2 format for homework compliance.

**See**: `series-planning/steampunk-gothic-eternal-garden/INTEGRATION-PLAN.md` for complete retrofit plan and 5-phase integration roadmap.

**Goal**: Demonstrate proper series-architect-2 skill usage while preserving all existing content and proposing thoughtful enhancements (NPE integration, genre pack integration, agent integration, MCP integration).
