## Stage 2: Research Phase

**Status:** [x] Complete
**Date Completed:** 2025-11-23

**Approach:**
- [x] Hybrid (existing foundation + 2024-2025 web research)

**Research Sources:**
- User-provided foundation docs (market-research.md, worldbuilding-bible.md, character-psychology.md)
- Supplemental web research (2024-2025 Gothic horror, steampunk, female anti-hero trends)
- Market analysis: Sapphic romance + steampunk crossover potential

**Output:** eternal_garden_research.md (comprehensive synthesis)

**Key Decision:** Based on 2024-2025 market research, pivoted to integrate sapphic romance for commercial optimization (2-3x revenue potential). Heat level increased 2→4. Romance arc to be layered over cure quest while maintaining steampunk tech as primary plot driver.

---

## Stage 3: Series Framework

**Status:** [x] Complete
**Date Completed:** 2025-11-23

**Approach:**
- [x] Full planning (expanded series_framework.md with complete romance + steampunk integration)

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Update heat level (2→4) and genre tags (added "Sapphic Dark Romance")
- [x] Integrate 5-book sapphic romance arc structure (detailed book-by-book progression)
- [x] Expand character arcs with romantic development (Celeste and Margot romance arcs defined)
- [x] Define romance beat spacing and intimate scene placement (every 3-4 chapters, 0-3 scenes per book)
- [x] Ensure steampunk tech remains primary plot driver (60/40 plot/romance split maintained)
- [x] Add romance tropes (14 total: captor/captive, enemies-to-lovers, sapphic monster romance, etc.)
- [x] Update market positioning with sapphic romance comp titles and revenue projections
- [x] Define series continuity tracking for romance progression

**Outputs:**
- series_framework.md fully expanded (33 sections, comprehensive romance integration)

**Note:** Successfully layered sapphic romance over existing steampunk/horror foundation while maintaining cure quest as primary driver

## Stage 4: Story Dossier Selection

**Status:** [x] Complete
**Date Completed:** 2025-11-23

**Dossier Source:**
- [ ] User-provided
- [x] Library template
- [ ] Custom build

**Template Selected:** `beat_sheet_library/Romantasy_The_Beats.md`

**Rationale:**
- Dual-thread structure (Fantasy/Romance → Steampunk Plot/Romance) supports 60/40 split naturally
- Strong external plot framework (world-changing events, battles, tech systems as drivers)
- Romance grows FROM plot events (forced proximity, shared danger, collaborative work)
- 5-Act structure (18 core beats + 6 optional bonus beats) maps to 5-book series progression
- Beats adaptable: Magic → Mechanical, Court → Gardens/Vampire Court, Prophecy → Cure research

**Adaptation Strategy:**
- "Fantasy thread" becomes "Steampunk cure quest thread" (60% narrative focus)
- "Romance thread" remains sapphic romance development (40% narrative focus)
- Each beat balances both threads with steampunk primary, romance enhancing
- Acts I-V provide structural framework for layering over existing Books 1-3 outlines

**Stage 5 Plan:**
- Use Romantasy beats to validate/enhance existing Books 1-3 chapter structures
- Develop Books 4-5 using Romantasy framework directly
- Layer romance beats into cure quest milestones
