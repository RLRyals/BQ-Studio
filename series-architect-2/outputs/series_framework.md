## Series Premise

Victorian London, 1885. Celeste Hartwell, a brilliant vampire inventor and serial killer, locked herself in an underground steampunk wonderland to work on a mechanical cure for vampirism. When thief Margot breaks in, she becomes the first person to breach Celeste's 15-year isolation—and her unlikely partner in an impossible quest that will blur the lines between captive and keeper, monster and lover, damnation and redemption.

---

## Series Arc

**Central Conflict:**
Can a monster who seeks a cure deserve redemption—and love? As Celeste and Margot pursue a mechanical solution to vampirism, their partnership evolves from captive/captor to collaborators to something far more dangerous. They must confront whether changing one's nature is possible, whether a psychopath can truly love, and whether Margot's feelings are real or a survival mechanism twisted into Stockholm syndrome.

**Escalation Pattern:**
- **Book 1: The Eternal Garden** - Isolation → Partnership (cure attempt fails, Margot becomes keeper)
- **Book 2: The Clockwork Cure** - Complications (partial success, violent reversion, external pressures)
- **Book 3: The Mechanical Heart** - Crisis (split consciousness, Augustus dies, external threats breach)
- **Book 4: TBD** - Escalation (all threats converge, sacrifice required)
- **Book 5: TBD** - Resolution (final cure attempt, redemption or acceptance)

**Theme:**
The nature of humanity, the cost of redemption, and the line between helping and enabling monstrosity. Can genuine love exist between a psychopath incapable of empathy and her captive? Where does survival strategy end and authentic desire begin?
