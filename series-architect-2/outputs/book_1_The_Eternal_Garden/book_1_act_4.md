### Major Events
1. Days after cure attempt, Week 10
2. Celeste's horror: First time showing something like guilt

9. **Emotional Beat**: Closest Celeste has come to empathy; questions what it means
10. **Chapter End**: Celeste leaves journal entry: "I don't want her to leave."

**Character Development**:
- Celeste: Guilt (novel emotion), self-reflection (rare), values Margot beyond utility
- Augustus: Mediator role, repairs apparatus, concerned for both

**Emotional Beats**:
- Celeste's confusion at own guilt
- Recognition that Margot's presence matters
- Vulnerability (doesn't want to be alone again)

### Major Events
1. Week 11, Margot must choose: leave or stay
2. Celeste's offer: Augustus will help her escape, no retaliation, genuine
3. **The temptation**: Freedom, safety, normalcy, life in London
4. **Counter-argument**: Research is important; cure could help others; she's invested now
5. Margot's past surfaces: Reveals why she became thief (fleeing abusive situation - partner? family?)
6. **The parallel**: Running from one cage into another; tired of running
7. Augustus's advice: "Leave while you can. This won't end well."
8. **Margot's choice**: Stays
9. **Rationalization**: "The research matters. The cure could save others."
10. **Emotional Beat**: Crossing point of no return; full complicity accepted
11. **ACT TURN**: Margot commits to partnership, not just survival
12. **Chapter End**: "Let's try again. But this time, I design the safety protocols."

**Power Dynamic Shift**: 100/0 → 70/30 (Margot demands safety protocols, equal voice in research)
