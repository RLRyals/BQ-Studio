# Voice Profile (Deep 3rd + Word-Painting)

**Guidance:** This is the baseline, personality-anchored style for the POV character. It persists across books unless the character’s core voice changes.

**Sliders (1–7)**
- Cadence: __  # 1–2 clipped; 3–5 mixed; 6–7 long-period
- Imagery: __  # 1–2 spare; 3–5 balanced; 6–7 lush
- Figurative: __  # 1–2 literal; 3–5 light; 6–7 figurative-forward (≤1 in-world metaphor/scene)
- Specificity: __  # 1–2 gist; 3–5 concrete; 6–7 granular (jargon if POV knows)
- Sensory: __  # 1–2 vision-led; 3–5 multi; 6–7 rich multi (sound/touch bias ok)
- Heat/Violence: __  # 1–2 off-page; 3–5 moderate; 6–7 explicit
- Diction/Formality: __  # 1–2 colloquial; 3–5 neutral/precise; 6–7 formal

**Word-Painting Anchors**
- Dominant Impression (3 words): __, __, __
- Texture/Color Palette (2–3): __, __, __
- Lexicon / Bias Notes (optional): __

**Deep 3rd + WP Rules (always-on)**
- No filter verbs (saw/felt/knew/realized/etc.); camera = character
- Emotion via embodiment (physiology, cadence, choice)
- Concrete > abstract; ≤1 in-world metaphor; multisensory anchors
- Advance ≥2 of Goal/Opposition/Revelation per scene; end on a hot potato

**Examples (optional)**
- Sentence music cues the mood; palette recurs across scenes; diction stays in-character
