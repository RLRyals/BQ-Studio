## authorial_style_and_voice

**reader_experience_goal:** [In one sentence, how should readers feel while reading this book?]

### core_prose_style_directives

**pacing_and_rhythm:** [How fast should the story feel? Are sentences generally short and direct (for action, thrillers) or longer and more descriptive (for literary, fantasy, historical)?]

**level_of_detail:** [How much description should there be? Do we focus only on details that are critical to the plot, or do we linger on sensory information (sights, sounds, smells) to build atmosphere?]

**diversify_vocabulary_and_avoid_predictable_phrasing:** Use a broad range of accessible vocabulary to avoid repetitive or overused phrases. However, language should match the genre conventions and, unless specified by the character voice, language should be simple, active and logical. This keeps the writing fresh and engaging while maintaining the unique voice of each character.

**action_vs_introspection:** [What is the balance between what a character *does* and what a character *thinks*? Is this a story driven by external action or internal reflection? (e.g., 70% action/dialogue, 30% internal thought).]

**language_formality:** [Is the language simple and modern, or more formal and stylized? Limit stylized language, metaphors, or genre-specific flourishes unless project or author style demands.]

**show_don't_tell:** Emotion must be shown through dialogue, physical actions, environmental interaction, and sensory details. Avoid lengthy explanations of what characters are feeling or thinking about their feelings. If a character is angry, show them slamming a door or speaking in clipped sentences, don't explain their anger management philosophy.

### core_voice_and_emotion

**voice_authenticity_directive:** All descriptions, metaphors, and observations must be things the POV character would realistically notice or think. Their profession, mood, and past experiences must dictate what they see and how they describe it. Only include information from shared scenes/experiences in previous scenes that are externally observable.

**emotion_rendering:** Express emotion through body language, visceral sensations, and layered sensory detail that advances plot or insight. Show emotion through: (1) dialogue and what characters choose to say or NOT say, (2) physical actions and body language, (3) environmental interaction, (4) sensory details filtered through emotion.

**banned_tropes_and_phrases:** [Provide a simple, bulleted list of specific clichés or phrases to avoid. e.g., "- 'breath he didn't know he was holding', - 'shivers down his spine', - mustache-twirling villains, - info-dumping butlers." The goal of this list is to proactively avoid poor word choice and telltale signs of AI-writing.]

### pacing_and_scene_dynamics

**the_opening_rule:** [Open with immediate relevance—dialogue or action first, with POV and emotional stakes established through what characters DO and SAY, not what they think. If internal thought is used for orientation, limit to one sentence maximum. Never start with generic weather, clock, or sun/moon references.]

**the_closing_rule:** [End scenes on a hook: unresolved question, sharp emotion, or brewing consequence. Mini-cliffhangers are good. Move the story forward with every closure.]

**single_pov_per_scene:** [Maintain one clear POV per scene; never head-hop. Only include info from shared scenes/experiences in previous scenes that are externally observable.]

**scene_momentum_priority:** [Start scenes mid-action or mid-conversation whenever possible. Use dialogue to reveal backstory, emotion, and character development. Show relationship dynamics through banter, interruptions, and subtext. Action beats should advance plot or reveal character; avoid filler actions. Internal thought should react to external stimuli, not replace it.]

**the_momentum_rule:** [Every scene must maintain forward momentum. Cut any paragraph that could be summarized as "Character thinks about their feelings." Instead, have them DO something about their feelings—make a phone call, storm out, kiss someone, throw something, start baking aggressively, etc. Every scene must move the story forward. If a scene doesn't reveal new information, advance the plot, or develop a character's arc, it should be cut.]
