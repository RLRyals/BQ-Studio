## Selection Decision Tree

### Step 1: Identify Primary Genre

**Romance-focused (romance is the plot):**
- Contemporary, low fantasy → Romance Beat Sheet
- Paranormal, fantasy world → Romantasy 20 Beats or Romantasy - The Beats
- Dark themes, morally gray → Dark Romancing The Beats

**Romance + substantial external plot:**
- Equal weight romance/adventure → Romantasy - The Beats
- Fantasy quest with romance subplot → Romantasy 20 Beats

**Non-romance:**
- Any other genre → Three-Act Structure

### Step 2: Check for Trauma Themes

**If trauma/recovery is central to character arc:**
- Both MCs trauma survivors → A: Mutual Trauma Bonding
- Protector/wounded dynamic → B: Protector × Wounded
- Addiction/destructive patterns → C: Toxic Coping → Healing
- PTSD/reintegration → D: Post-Trauma Re-Entry
- Dark romance + trauma → E: Dark Trauma Hybrid

### Step 3: Validate Heat Level Compatibility

Match your target heat level to framework range:
- Heat 1-2 (clean/sweet) → Romance Beat Sheet, D: Post-Trauma Re-Entry
- Heat 2-3 (moderate) → Romance Beat Sheet, Romantasy 20 Beats, A-D frameworks
- Heat 3-4 (steamy) → Romantasy - The Beats, Dark Romancing, A-E frameworks
- Heat 5 (explicit) → Romantasy - The Beats, Dark Romancing, E: Dark Trauma Hybrid

### Step 4: Consider Series vs. Standalone

**Series:**
- Use same framework across all books for consistency
- Romantasy 20 Beats designed for series
- Traumancing frameworks can extend across series

**Standalone:**
- Any framework works
- Three-Act Structure simplest for one-off projects

## Using a Beat Sheet

### 1. Load the Selected Framework
Read the entire beat sheet to understand:
- Overall structure and phase progression
- Target word count percentages for each beat
- Required story elements at each turning point
- Special features (consent checkpoints, worldbuilding beats, etc.)

### 2. Map Your Story to Beats
For each beat in the framework:
- **Scene description:** What literally happens
- **Character development:** How MCs change
- **Emotional beats:** What readers should feel
- **Plot advancement:** How external story progresses
- **Relationship progression:** (Romance) Where are MCs emotionally?

### 3. Customize as Needed
Beat sheets are guides, not prison bars:
- **Add beats** for complex subplots
- **Merge beats** if story is simpler
- **Adjust percentages** slightly for pacing
- **Skip optional beats** if not relevant

**NEVER skip:**
- Opening image / setup
- Inciting incident / meet-cute
- Midpoint / turning point
- Climax / black moment
- Resolution / HEA/HFN

### 4. Integrate with Other Planning
Beat sheets work alongside:
- **Character arcs:** Map character transformation to beat progression
- **Worldbuilding:** Ensure world rules create obstacles at key beats
- **Subplot tracking:** Weave B/C plots through main beat structure
- **Trope execution:** Deliver trope payoffs at emotionally optimal beats

---

## Framework Combinations

### For Complex Projects

**Multi-POV Romance:**
- Primary POV: Full beat sheet
- Secondary POV: Mirror beats from their perspective
- Ensure beats hit from both angles

**Romance + Mystery/Thriller:**
- Romance beats: Relationship progression
- Three-Act Structure: Mystery/thriller plot
- Integrate both so they support each other

**Series with Overarching Plot:**
- Book-level: Romance beat sheet per book
- Series-level: Three-act structure across all books
- Each book = one act of overall series arc

---

## Customizing Beat Sheets

### When to Create Custom Framework

Create new beat sheet when:
- Existing frameworks don't fit your genre
- Unique structure required (non-linear, epistolary, etc.)
- Blending multiple genres in unusual ways
- Series has consistent unique structure

**How to create:** See `references/create_new_beat_frameworks.md`

### Common Modifications

**Extend Romance Beats:**
- Add beats for polyamory (multiple relationship arcs)
- Add beats for LGBTQ+ specific elements (coming out, chosen family)
- Add beats for disability representation (access, accommodation, identity)

**Compress for Novellas:**
- Merge adjacent beats
- Reduce from 12-20 beats to 8-10 beats
- Maintain opening, midpoint, climax, resolution

**Expand for Epic:**
- Split each act into sub-acts
- Add worldbuilding/politics beats
- Extend from 20 beats to 30+ for door-stoppers

## Integration with Series Architect Workflow

**Stage 5, Step 1:** Beat sheet selection occurs here
- Resource Discovery Protocol scans beat_sheet_library/
- AI presents 3-5 most relevant frameworks based on:
  - Genre from intake form
  - Heat/violence levels
  - Trauma themes detected
  - Series vs. standalone
- User approves selection or requests alternative
- Selected framework guides all subsequent development

**Post-Selection:**
- Character arcs (Step 2) align with beat structure
- Worldbuilding (Step 3) creates obstacles/opportunities at key beats
- Beat outlines (Step 4) map this book's story to framework
- Scene detail (Step 6) expands each beat into scenes/chapters

---

## Troubleshooting

### "None of these fit my story"
**Solution:** Use Three-Act Structure as base, customize heavily, or create custom framework (see create_new_beat_frameworks.md)

### "I need elements from two frameworks"
**Solution:** Choose primary framework for structure, cherry-pick specific beats from secondary as needed

### "Beat sheet feels formulaic"
**Solution:** Beat sheets provide structure, not content. Unique voice, characters, and world make story distinctive. Structure enables creativity, doesn't constrain it.

### "My story doesn't fit percentages"
**Solution:** Percentages are guidelines. ±5% variation is normal. Ensure major beats hit in correct order, exact word count less important.
