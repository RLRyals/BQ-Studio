# Outline Size Policy

Moderate caps to keep chapter outlines concise and actionable.

## Defaults (per chapter outline)
- brief: 80–120 words; 5–8 major events
- normal (default): 120–180 words; 6–10 major events
- detailed: 200–260 words; 8–12 major events

Apply these caps when generating act-level chapter breakdowns (Acts 1–5, separate documents). The cap refers to the prose summary within the chapter section, excluding headings. “Major events” refers to the bullet list under the “Major Events” subsection.

## Guidance
- Focus chapter objectives and emotional arcs; avoid micro-beat transcription.
- Keep numbered bullets action-focused; defer line-level choreography to drafting.
- Use vocabulary consistent with dossier voice; avoid cliché morphemes.

## Enforcement
- During Stage 5, run an outline size evaluation and flag chapters exceeding caps.
- If repeated overages occur, lower verbosity or switch to brief mode temporarily, then expand selected chapters only after review.
