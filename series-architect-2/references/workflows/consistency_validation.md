# Consistency Validation

Cross-document assertions to ensure coherence across beats, character arcs, and world rules before approving Stage 5 and generating outputs.

---

## Character ↔ Beats
- Named characters present in dossier match profiles (spelling and role).
- Arc beats (want/need/flaw) appear consistently in story beats and climax.
- Relationship progression aligns with chosen romance beat framework (no skipped or reversed critical beats unless intentional and noted).

## World Rules ↔ Events
- Supernatural rules (capabilities/constraints) are applied consistently in key scenes.
- Political hierarchies and factions referenced consistently (no contradictory leadership or alliances across acts).

## Heat/Violence ↔ Scenes
- Scene content stays within declared heat and violence benchmarks.
- Any escalation beyond benchmarks is intentional and flagged for approval.

## Series Continuity
- Persistent objects/locations retain identity and properties across books.
- Character statuses (injuries, secrets revealed, relationship state) are carried over or deliberately reset with justification.

## Implementation
- Run validations before closing Stage 5. Attach a discrepancy report to the stage review.
- Offer auto-fix suggestions (rewrite a beat, adjust arc note, update world rule memo). Apply only on approval.
