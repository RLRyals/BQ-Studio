# Stage 3: Series Framework (Multi-Book Only)

**Note:** This stage is skipped for standalone novels.

## Optimization Check: Market-Driven Decision Shortcut

**Before granular questions, check for market-driven signals:**

### Signals User Wants Market-Optimal Synthesis

- Stage 1: User said "write to market" or "let research drive decisions"
- Stage 1: User chose research-heavy approach
- User's development_approach contains market-driven language
- User deferred creative decisions to "market research" during intake

### If Market-Driven Signals Detected

Load `references/workflows/market_driven_shortcut.md` and apply:

1. **Synthesize optimal package** using Stage 2 research findings:
   - Identify highest-demand species/world elements
   - Select top-performing trope combinations (2-3)
   - Choose proven series structure for genre
   - Design series conflict leveraging chosen elements
   - Map universal fantasies to genre expectations

2. **Present as complete package** with market rationale

3. **Wait for response:**
   - If approved → Skip to Decision Point 3B (series framework development)
   - If wants to customize → Proceed to Decision Point 3A below

### If Creative Exploration Signals Detected

Proceed with Decision Point 3A below.

## Decision Point 3A: Series-Level Planning

If multi-book series, determine scope:
- **Option A**: Full series arc planning (overarching conflict, character journeys across books)
- **Option B**: Book-by-book development (minimal series scaffolding)
- **Option C**: Hybrid (key series threads + book-specific focus)

Present options and ask: "Which approach fits your creative process?"

**Wait for user response.**

## If Option A or C Selected

### Step 1: Generate Series Title (If Needed)

**Check intake form for title status:**
- If user provided title → Use as-is
- If "Generate" or blank → Generate market-appropriate title

**Title Generation Guidelines:**
- Reflects genre conventions (paranormal = evocative/dark, contemporary = emotional/relatable, etc.)
- Hints at core conflict or theme
- Works for series branding (memorable, searchable)
- 2-5 words ideal for romance
- Present 2-3 options using Recommendation Approval Protocol

**Wait for user approval if generating title.**

### Step 2: Develop Series Bible Components

Develop series bible components:
- Overarching series conflict/question
- Character arcs spanning multiple books
- Recurring elements (settings, secondary characters, themes)
- Escalation pattern across books

Update `outputs/series_framework.md` with all creative details (including approved title).

## If Option B Selected

### Step 1: Generate Series Title (If Needed)

**Same title generation process as Option A/C above.**

### Step 2: Minimal Series Scaffolding

- Document minimal series scaffolding (title, book count, basic premise per book)
- Skip detailed series bible
- Proceed directly to Stage 4

## Decision Point 3B: Series Framework Review

Present draft series framework using **Recommendation Approval Protocol**:
- Summarize series structure
- Ask: "Type 'approved' to accept and continue, or let me know what to adjust."

**Wait for user response.**

If revisions needed, incorporate feedback and re-present.
Once approved, proceed to Stage 4.

## Before Proceeding to Stage 4

**Execute Stage Transition Protocol:**
1. Update intake_form.md - Mark Stage 3 complete, note planning approach
2. Update series_framework.md - Fill in all creative details determined this stage
3. Update memory.json - Record framework completion, add changelog
4. Proceed to Stage 4
