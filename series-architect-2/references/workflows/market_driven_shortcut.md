# Market-Driven Decision Shortcut

**OPTIMIZATION: Detect user signals and synthesize optimal packages**

## When to Use This Shortcut

**Check for market-driven signals before granular questioning:**

### Signals User Wants Market-Optimal Synthesis

- Stage 1: User said "write to market" or "let research drive decisions"
- Stage 1: User chose research-heavy approach
- User's development_approach contains market-driven language
- User deferred creative decisions to "market research" during intake
- User consistently approves AI recommendations with "approved"

## Market-Driven Approach (Stage 3 Example)

**Instead of asking 4 separate questions:**
1. Supernatural species?
2. Core tropes?
3. Series structure?
4. Overarching conflict?

**Synthesize optimal package using Stage 2 research:**

1. **Generate series title (if not provided)** - Market-appropriate, genre-fitting
2. **Identify highest-demand species/world elements**
3. **Select top-performing trope combinations (2-3)**
4. **Choose proven series structure for genre**
5. **Design series conflict leveraging chosen elements**
6. **Map universal fantasies to genre expectations**

## Present Complete Package

**Format:**
```
Based on your 'write to market' approach and the research, here's the optimal commercial package:

**Series Title:** [Title options if none provided, or user's title if provided]
**Species Pairing:** [Choice + brief market rationale]
**Core Tropes:** [List + why these work together]
**Series Structure:** [Structure + how it supports escalation]
**Overarching Conflict:** [Conflict + emotional driver]

**Market rationale:** [1-2 sentences on why this combination performs]

Type 'approved' to accept and continue, or let me know what you'd like to adjust.
```

## User Response Handling

- **If approved** → Skip to developing full series framework
- **If wants to customize** → Break into individual decisions
- **If requests alternatives** → Present 2-3 alternative packages

## Creative Exploration Approach

**If user shows these signals:**
- Wants to explore options
- Asks "what if" questions
- Has strong creative vision
- Prefers building collaboratively

**Then:**
- Proceed with granular Decision Point questions
- Present options with trade-offs
- Explain reasoning in detail
- Take time to explore alternatives

## Hybrid Approach

**Adapt per decision point:**
- Some users want quick approvals for structural decisions
- But want deep exploration for character/world decisions
- Follow user's lead on pace and detail level per decision type

## Benefits

**For market-driven users:**
✅ Faster workflow - synthesized recommendations
✅ Research-backed decisions - AI analyzes market data
✅ Optimal combinations - elements that work together
✅ Still customizable - can adjust any element

**For workflow:**
✅ Eliminates unnecessary back-and-forth
✅ Keeps momentum when user trusts recommendations
✅ Reduces decision fatigue
✅ Adapts to user's decision-making style

## Integration with Recommendation Approval Protocol

Market-Driven Shortcut + Recommendation Approval Protocol work together:

1. **Detect market-driven signals** → Synthesize package
2. **Present recommendation with rationale** → Use approval format
3. **Wait for "approved"** → Execute immediately
4. **Update files and proceed** → Maintain momentum

This combination enables users to move through workflow quickly when they trust AI recommendations based on research.
