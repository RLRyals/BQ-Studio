- Extract relevant data for dossier
- Ask clarifying questions if gaps exist

### Option B: Web Search (Anthropic Search)
**When selected:**
- Ask user: "What research areas?" 
- Execute targeted web searches
- Synthesize findings
- Present key insights for user review

**Search query patterns:**
- "[genre] popular tropes 2024"
- "best [subgenre] books 2024"
- "[genre] reader expectations"
- "[trope] romance books"

## Red Flags in Research

**Watch for:**
- Genre expectations user's story violates (discuss with user)
- Oversaturated tropes (suggest fresh angles)
- Underserved audience needs (opportunity to highlight)
- Heat/violence mismatch with genre (clarify user's intent)

**When found, ask:**
"Research shows [genre] readers expect [X], but your story does [Y]. Intentional subversion or should we adjust?"
