# Series Architect Quick Start Guide

Get started planning your book series in under 5 minutes.

## What is Series Architect?

A structured workflow that takes you from "I have an idea" to a complete, chapter-by-chapter story plan for your book series.

**Perfect for:**
- Planning multi-book romance or fantasy series
- Creating detailed story outlines with beat sheets
- Organizing complex world-building and character arcs
- Writers who want structure without sacrificing creativity

---

## The 30-Second Version

1. **Answer questions** about your series (# of books, genre, heat level)
2. **Choose research** (use your own ideas, web research, or templates)
3. **Build framework** (series-wide elements like world/characters)
4. **Select beat sheet** (story structure template)
5. **Develop books** (detailed chapter-by-chapter planning)
6. **Export files** (markdown, docx, or packaged bundle)

---

## Three Ways to Start

### Option 1: Express Mode (Fastest - 1-2 hours per book)
**Best for:** Experienced writers, market-driven projects, "just tell me what works"

```
"I want to plan a series using Express mode"
```

- Minimal questions, smart defaults
- Stage-level approvals (not every tiny decision)
- Pre-built templates and beat sheets
- Light research, focus on output

### Option 2: Testing Mode (Demo - 30 minutes)
**Best for:** First-time users, exploring the system, seeing what it can do

```
"Start Testing mode - show me sample A"
```

- Choose from 5 curated sample projects (A-E)
- Pre-filled intake forms
- Skip questionnaires
- See end-to-end workflow quickly

**Available samples:**
- A: Mutual Trauma Bonding Romance
- B: Protector × Wounded Romance
- C: Toxic Coping → Healing Arc
- D: Post-Trauma Re-Entry Romance
- E: Dark Romance Trauma Hybrid

### Option 3: Comprehensive Mode (Thorough - 3-5 hours per book)
**Best for:** Complex projects, deep world-building, collaborative exploration

```
"I want to plan a series using Comprehensive mode"
```

- Detailed questions and exploration
- Micro-approvals for every decision
- Exhaustive diagnostics
- Deep research integration

## The 6-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Intake & Assessment (10-15 min)
**You'll answer:**
- How many books? How many chapters per book?
- Genre and sub-genre?
- Heat level (🌶️) and violence level (🔪)?
- Do you have existing materials?

**You'll get:**
- `outputs/intake_form.md` - Your project tracker
- `outputs/series_framework.md` - Your creative blueprint
- `outputs/memory.json` - Session state (for resuming later)

### Stage 2: Research Phase (15-30 min)
**You'll choose:**
- **Your own materials:** Use your existing research/notes
- **Web research:** AI searches market trends for your genre
- **Baseline:** Use built-in templates and genre knowledge
- **Hybrid:** Mix of the above

**You'll get:**
- Market research document (if web/hybrid)
- Genre best practices
- Trope and pacing recommendations

### Stage 3: Series Framework (30-60 min)
**For multi-book series only. Standalone novels skip this.**

**You'll develop:**
- Series-wide world-building (magic systems, politics, geography)
- Overarching series plot (the big story across all books)
- Recurring characters
- Series naming conventions

**You'll get:**
- `outputs/series_framework.md` - Your series bible
- Optional: `outputs/worldbuilding_guide.md`
- Optional: `outputs/series_romance_beats.md`

### Stage 4: Story Dossier Template (10 min)
**You'll choose:**
- Pre-built template from library (Truby-style, genre-neutral, etc.)
- Provide your own template
- Create custom template collaboratively

**You'll get:**
- Selected template ready for use in Stage 5

### Stage 5: Book-Level Development (1-3 hours per book)
**The main event. For each book:**

**Step 1:** Choose beat sheet (romance, romantasy, three-act, trauma-informed)
**Step 2:** Develop character profiles (wounds, arcs, desires)
**Step 3:** Build worldbuilding (if fantasy/paranormal)
**Step 4:** Create beat-by-beat outline
**Step 5:** Generate complete book dossier
**Step 6:** Expand to chapter summaries (optional)

**You'll get per book:**
- `outputs/book_[N]_[title]/book_[N]_dossier.md` - Complete story guide
- `outputs/book_[N]_[title]/book_[N]_act_[1-5].md` - Chapter breakdowns (optional)
- Character profiles
- Beat outlines

### Stage 6: Output Generation (10 min)
**You'll choose:**
- File format (markdown, multi-file, docx)
- Packaging (ZIP bundle, navigation index)
- Series master document

**You'll get:**
- `outputs/INDEX.md` - Navigation for all files
- All your planning documents organized
- Optional ZIP package for delivery

## Common Questions

### "How long does this take?"
- **Testing mode:** 30 minutes (1 book, minimal detail)
- **Express mode:** 1-2 hours per book (practical planning)
- **Comprehensive mode:** 3-5 hours per book (deep exploration)

### "Can I pause and resume?"
Yes! `memory.json` tracks your progress. Provide it when resuming and you'll pick up exactly where you left off.

### "Do I have to plan all books at once?"
No. You can:
- Plan Book 1 only (Option C in Stage 5)
- Plan high-level outlines for all books, detail Book 1 (Option B)
- Plan all books fully (Option A)

### "What if I don't know my heat level or chapter count?"
Express mode uses smart defaults. You can:
- Accept recommendations
- Adjust later
- Mark as "TBD" and decide during development

### "Can I use this for genres besides romance?"
Yes, but the tool is optimized for romance and romantasy. For other genres:
- Use Three-Act Structure beat sheet
- Skip romance-specific sections
- Templates are adaptable

### "What files will I end up with?"
Typical 3-book series in Express mode:
```
outputs/
├── memory.json                      # Session state
├── intake_form.md                   # Project tracker
├── series_framework.md              # Series bible
├── INDEX.md                         # Navigation
├── book_1_[title]/
│   ├── book_1_dossier.md           # Complete guide
│   ├── book_1_act_1.md             # Act 1 chapters
│   ├── book_1_act_2.md             # Act 2 chapters
│   └── ...                          # Acts 3-5
├── book_2_[title]/
│   └── ...                          # Same structure
└── book_3_[title]/
    └── ...                          # Same structure
```

## Getting Started Right Now

### For First-Time Users:
```
"Start Testing mode. I want to see sample B (Protector × Wounded)"
```

### For Experienced Writers Who Want Speed:
```
"I want to plan a 3-book paranormal romance series in Express mode.
- 20 chapters per book, ~75K words per book
- Heat level 4, violence level 2
- Let's start."

I have detailed world-building notes I'll provide. Let's start with intake."
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Do:
✅ Start with Testing mode if you're new (learn the system risk-free)
✅ Use Express mode for faster results (you can always add detail later)
✅ Save your memory.json file (resume capability is your friend)
✅ Provide existing materials if you have them (world notes, character sketches)
✅ Type "approved" for recommendations you like (keeps momentum)

### Don't:
❌ Skip stages (they build on each other)
❌ Overthink during intake (you can adjust later)
❌ Fight the defaults in Express mode (they're based on genre best practices)
❌ Forget to specify session mode (default is Express, which may not fit your needs)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "This feels overwhelming"
→ Use Testing mode first. 30 minutes, pre-filled sample, see the whole workflow.

### "I don't know which beat sheet to use"
→ AI will recommend based on your genre/heat level. Type "approved" to accept.

### "Can I change my mind later?"
→ Yes. Provide your memory.json and intake_form.md, specify what to revise.

### "I only want character and plot, not worldbuilding"
→ Tell the AI during Stage 3. Express mode won't force deep worldbuilding for contemporary.

### "Where's the full documentation?"
→ `SKILL.md` has complete details. Workflow files in `references/workflows/` explain each stage in depth.

## Next Steps

**Ready to start?**

Simply tell the AI:
- Your session mode (Express / Comprehensive / Testing)
- Your project type (# of books, genre)
- And let the workflow guide you

**Example:**
```
"Start Express mode. I want to plan a 4-book vampire romance series,
20 chapters per book, heat level 5. Let's begin."
```

The AI will handle the rest, walking you through each stage with clear decision points and recommendations.
