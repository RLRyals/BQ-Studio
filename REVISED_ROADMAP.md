# BQ Studio - Revised Roadmap & Issue Strategy

**Date:** 2025-11-21
**Status:** Clarified - CCWeb is temporary detour, not permanent pivot

---

## What Actually Happened

### Original Plan (Still Valid!)
Build Electron desktop app with:
- Electron + React + TypeScript UI
- **Postgres database** (not SQLite - MCPs use Postgres)
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Core services (AI, Database, File, Workflow, Event Bus)
- Series Architect, Penname Manager, Manuscript Writer plugins

### Temporary Detour (Next 3 Days)
- Use Claude Code Web to maximize **use-or-lose credits**
- Build Writing Team Agents (9 agents) + Agent Skills (5 skills)
- Connect to MCPs via Cloudflare tunnels
- Validate workflows and gather requirements

### Post-Weekend Integration (The Real Goal)
- **Return to Electron app development**
- **Keep Writing Team Agents and Skills** - they become the "brain"
- Connect Electron UI to Writing Team + MCPs
- Assess if CCWeb + tunnels remain useful or retire them

---

## Issue Status Revision

### ❌ DO NOT CLOSE Issues #5-25

All original issues remain valid! They're just **on hold** during the CCWeb detour.

---

## Issue Updates Needed

### Issue #8: Implement Database Service
**Status:** ✅ Completed but needs update
**Current:** Uses SQLite (better-sqlite3)
**Required:** Change to **Postgres** to match MCPs

**Action After Weekend:**
```
Update Database Service to use Postgres:
- Replace better-sqlite3 with pg or node-postgres
- Update migration system for Postgres syntax
- Maintain same DatabaseService interface
- Connect to same Postgres instance as MCPs
```

**Why:** Your MCPs already use Postgres. Electron app should share that database.

---

### Issues #6-11: Core Services
**Status:** ✅ Completed, ready for integration
**Action:** No changes needed yet, but will integrate with Writing Team

**Integration Strategy:**
- **AI Service** → Can invoke Writing Team Agents programmatically
- **Database Service** → Connect to Postgres (same as MCPs)
- **File Service** → Used by Writing Team for exports
- **Workflow Engine** → Orchestrates Agent Skills from UI
- **Event Bus** → Coordinates between UI, agents, and MCPs
- **Plugin Manager** → Loads plugins that use Writing Team

---

### Issues #15-21: Series Architect Plugin
**Status:** Waiting for Electron app
**New Strategy:** Plugin becomes UI wrapper around Agent Skills

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Electron UI (React)                    │
│  Series Architect Plugin                │
│  - Planning view                        │
│  - Character editor                     │
│  - Chapter organizer                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                ↓ invokes
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Writing Team Agents (.claude/agents/)  │
│  Miranda, Bailey, Tessa, etc.           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                ↓ uses
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Agent Skills (.claude/skills/)         │
│  series-planning, chapter-planning, etc.│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                ↓ calls
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MCP Servers (Postgres)                 │
│  9 servers for data persistence         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What this means:**
- Electron UI provides visual interface
- User clicks "Plan Chapter" button
- Plugin invokes `chapter-planning-skill` via AI Service
- Skill coordinates Writing Team Agents
- Agents call MCP servers for data
- Results display in Electron UI

**Best of both worlds!**

## Infrastructure Dependencies

### MCP-Electron-App Repository
**Location:** `RYALS\MCP-Electron-App`

**What it provides:**
- ✅ Postgres database in Docker
- ✅ PgBouncer connection pooler
- ✅ Typing Mind website
- ✅ MCP connector for Typing Mind
- ✅ 9 MCP Writing Servers (series, book, chapter, character, scene, continuity, review, reporting, author)

**BQ Studio depends on:**
1. MCP-Electron-App must be running
2. Postgres accessible via PgBouncer (typically port 6432)
3. MCP servers accessible (ports 3000-3008 or via tunnels)

**Relationship:**
```
MCP-Electron-App = Infrastructure Provider (database + servers)
BQ-Studio        = Client Application (UI + workflow orchestration)
```

**Development Setup:**
1. Start MCP-Electron-App first
2. Note Postgres connection string (from MCP-Electron-App .env)
3. Note MCP server URLs (http://localhost:3000-3008)
4. Configure BQ Studio .env with these values
5. Start BQ Studio Electron app

**Production/Shared Setup:**
- Both apps can run simultaneously
- Both connect to same Postgres instance
- BQ Studio focuses on series/manuscript workflows
- Typing Mind provides general AI chat interface
- Shared character/scene data across both interfaces

---

## Post-Weekend: Electron + Writing Team Integration

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Week 1)
**Resume Issues #5, #12-13:**

1. **Issue #5: Set up Electron + React + TypeScript**
   - Use existing package.json as starting point
   - Add Writing Team agent invocation capabilities
   - Connect to local Postgres (not SQLite)

2. **Issue #12: Create Dashboard Layout**
   - Dashboard shows: Active projects, recent work, quick actions
   - "Plan New Series" button → invokes series-planning-skill
   - Recent chapters/scenes feed from MCP servers

3. **Issue #13: Create Workspace Layout**
   - Left sidebar: Project tree (series → books → chapters → scenes)
   - Center panel: Content editor
   - Right sidebar: Writing Team chat interface
   - Bottom panel: Agent activity log

**Key Addition:** Chat interface where user can talk to Writing Team like in CCWeb

---

### Phase 2: Writing Team Integration (Week 2)
**New Issues to Create:**

#### Issue #26: Integrate Writing Team Agents into AI Service
**Description:**
```
Update AIService.ts to support Writing Team agent invocation:

- Add `invokeAgent(agentName, prompt)` method
- Map agent names to .claude/agents/*.md files
- Stream agent responses to UI
- Log agent interactions to Event Bus
- Handle agent coordination (Miranda → Bailey → Tessa flow)

Integration points:
- Agent responses appear in right sidebar chat
- User can invoke specific agents or let system choose
- Agents can trigger UI updates (e.g., "Chapter saved to database")

Files to update:
- src/core/ai-service/AIService.ts
- src/core/ai-service/AgentCoordinator.ts (new)
```

---

#### Issue #27: Integrate Agent Skills into Workflow Engine
**Description:**
```
Connect Agent Skills to Workflow Engine:

- Each Agent Skill becomes a workflow stage
- UI buttons trigger skill invocation
- Skills execute via AI Service
- Progress shown in UI with status updates
- Results saved to Postgres via MCPs

Example workflow:
1. User clicks "Plan Chapter 5"
2. WorkflowEngine invokes chapter-planning-skill
3. Skill coordinates Miranda → Dr. Viktor → Detective Logan
4. Each agent's work streams to UI chat
5. Final chapter plan saves to chapter-planning-server MCP
6. UI updates chapter tree with new plan

Files to update:
- src/core/workflow-engine/WorkflowEngine.ts
- src/core/workflow-engine/SkillAdapter.ts (new)
```

---

#### Issue #28: Connect Database Service to Shared Postgres
**Description:**
```
Update Database Service from SQLite to Postgres:

- Replace better-sqlite3 with pg
- Update migration system for Postgres syntax
- Connect to shared Postgres instance from MCP-Electron-App
- Connect via PgBouncer for connection pooling
- Update schema to match MCP server expectations
- Maintain existing DatabaseService interface

Configuration:
- Read Postgres connection string from .env
- Connection string points to MCP-Electron-App's PgBouncer
- Example: postgresql://user:pass@localhost:6432/bq_studio
- No need to manage Postgres lifecycle (runs in MCP-Electron-App)

Infrastructure Dependencies:
- Requires MCP-Electron-App running
- Requires Postgres + PgBouncer accessible
- Shared database with MCP servers

Files to update:
- src/core/database-service/DatabaseService.ts
- src/core/database-service/migrations/*.sql (update syntax)
- package.json (remove better-sqlite3, add pg)
- .env.example (document connection string format)
```

---

#### Issue #29: Add MCP Server Communication Layer
**Description:**
```
Create MCP client in BQ Studio Electron app:

- Electron main process connects to MCP servers running in MCP-Electron-App
- IPC bridge between renderer and MCP servers
- Handle authentication (MCP_AUTH_TOKEN)
- Connection management (reconnect on failure)
- Request queuing and retry logic
- Support both local (MCP-Electron-App) and tunnel (CCWeb) connections

Architecture:
┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐
│ BQ Studio    │  IPC    │ BQ Studio    │  HTTP   │ MCP-Electron-App    │
│ React UI     │ <-----> │ Electron     │ <-----> │ MCP Servers         │
│ (Renderer)   │         │ Main Process │         │ (Postgres + MCPs)   │
└──────────────┘         └──────────────┘         └─────────────────────┘

Configuration:
- Read MCP server URLs from .env
- Local mode: http://localhost:3000-3008 (MCP-Electron-App)
- Tunnel mode: https://*.trycloudflare.com (for CCWeb)

Infrastructure Dependencies:
- Requires MCP-Electron-App running
- Requires 9 MCP servers accessible
- Shared Postgres database via MCP servers

New files:
- src/main/mcp/MCPClient.ts
- src/main/mcp/MCPBridge.ts

    └── useAgentSkill.ts
```

---

### Phase 3: Testing & Polish (Week 3)
**Resume Issue #14:**

Update scope to cover:
- Agent Skills integration testing
- MCP server connectivity tests
- UI component tests
- E2E workflow tests (series planning → manuscript export)

---

## Database Architecture Decision

### ✅ Postgres (Shared Infrastructure)

**Your Setup:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MCP-Electron-App Repository               │
│  (Infrastructure Provider)                 │
│                                            │
│  Docker Compose:                           │
│  ├── Postgres database                     │
│  ├── PgBouncer (connection pooler)         │
│  ├── Typing Mind website                   │
│  ├── MCP connector for Typing Mind         │
│  └── 9 MCP Writing Servers (likely here)   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓ shared connection
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BQ-Studio Repository                      │
│  (Client Application)                      │
│                                            │
│  Electron App:                             │
│  ├── React UI for writing workflows        │
│  ├── Connects to shared Postgres via       │
│  │   PgBouncer (connection string)         │
│  ├── Invokes Writing Team Agents           │
│  └── Uses Agent Skills                     │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Postgres already running - no setup needed
- ✅ PgBouncer provides connection pooling
- ✅ MCP servers already connected
- ✅ Single infrastructure for all writing tools
- ✅ BQ Studio is lightweight client app

**Configuration:**
BQ Studio needs connection details from MCP-Electron-App:
- Postgres host/port (via PgBouncer)
- Database name
- Authentication credentials
- Connection pooling already handled by PgBouncer

**Recommendation:** BQ Studio connects as client to shared infrastructure. No Docker setup needed in this repo.

---

## Cloudflare Tunnels: Reassessment Criteria

### After Free Credits End, Ask:

1. **Do you still use CCWeb frequently?**
   - If YES → Keep tunnels for remote access
   - If NO → Remove tunnels, MCP servers only accessible via Electron app

2. **Do Writing Team Agents work better in CCWeb or Electron?**
   - If CCWeb → Keep tunnels, Electron app calls CCWeb agents
   - If Electron → Remove tunnels, agents invoked locally via AI Service

3. **Do you collaborate with others remotely?**
   - If YES → Keep tunnels for team access
   - If NO → Local Electron app sufficient

**Likely outcome:** Remove tunnels, keep Writing Team agents as prompts that Electron app invokes.
