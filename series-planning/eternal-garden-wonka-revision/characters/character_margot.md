---

## Core Character Architecture

### Ghost/Wound
**Inciting traumatic event:** Abandoned by her mother at age 7 (1868), left at workhouse. Father unknown. The abandonment created deep-seated belief that she is fundamentally unlovable and disposable.

**Secondary wound:** Betrayal by Daniel (age 20, 1881) when he chose a wealthier woman over her, reinforcing the belief that love is transactional—she must be useful to be kept.

**Tertiary wound:** 4 years surviving on London streets as thief, witnessing and experiencing violence, learning that trust gets you killed.

### Misbelief/Lie
**Primary lie:** "Love is a transaction. If I'm not useful, I'll be discarded again."

**Secondary lie:** "Survival is all that matters. Morality is a luxury for people with safety."

**Romance-specific lie:** "My feelings for Celeste are Stockholm syndrome—a survival mechanism my brain created to keep me alive. They're not real."

**Self-protective lie:** "I can leave anytime I want. I'm choosing to stay for practical reasons (safety, food, shelter), not because I want her."

### Need (Psychological)
**What she must learn:** That her feelings—even if born from survival instinct—are still REAL and still HERS. That authenticity isn't about the origin of love, but about the choice to act on it.

**Ultimate need:** To accept that staying with Celeste is an authentic choice driven by genuine desire, not coercion or Stockholm syndrome. To claim her own agency in loving a monster.

**Moral need:** To recognize where her moral boundaries actually are (not abstract ideals, but real lines she won't cross) and decide if Celeste is worth crossing some of them.

### Want (External)
**Primary want:** Survival, safety, freedom from poverty and street violence

**Secondary want (emerges):** To be valued for her mind, not just her body or utility (Celeste gives her this)

**Romance want (Book 2+):** To be loved authentically, not as a tool or possession—but she fears Celeste can't give this

**Late-series want:** To know if she's genuinely in love or just very good at surviving

## Character Arc (5-Book Progression)

### Book 1: The Eternal Garden
**Starting point:** Professional thief on hired job, becomes terrified sole survivor of crew elimination
**Transformation:** Wonka test survivor → Captive witness to Augustus's pitch → Discovers intellect is valued → Survival → Partnership
**Ending point:** Chooses to become keeper voluntarily (first agency in years); crew deaths provide blood supply

### Book 2: The Clockwork Cure
**Starting point:** Equal research partner, denies attraction (doesn't trust it)
**Transformation:** Daniel's arrival forces confrontation—she doesn't WANT rescue anymore; realization terrifies her
**Ending point:** Sends Daniel away, chooses Gardens; first kiss (claims it was crisis response, not desire)

### Book 3: The Mechanical Heart
**Starting point:** Sexual relationship begins, frames it as pragmatic (staying warm, passing time)
**Transformation:** Split consciousness exposes her to two versions of love—genuine empathy (Human-C) vs. obsessive mimicry (Vampire-C)
**Ending point:** Chooses Vampire-Celeste over Human-Celeste; must confront: does she love the monster, or the familiar?

### Book 4: [The Brass Requiem]
**Starting point:** Established relationship, but authenticity crisis intensifies under external pressure
**Transformation:** Forced to choose between Celeste and innocents; chooses Celeste; crosses moral event horizon
**Ending point:** Moral corruption complete; can no longer claim she's the "good one" in this relationship

### Book 5: [The Last Invention]
**Starting point:** Fully complicit in Celeste's monstrosity, relationship stable but haunted
**Transformation:** Final cure attempt forces question: does she WANT Celeste cured, or does she love the monster?
**Ending point:** [Resolution depends on ending chosen - accepts her authentic desire for Vampire-Celeste as real love]

---

## Internal Conflict

**Primary conflict:** Are my feelings for Celeste real, or am I just very good at surviving? Is this Stockholm syndrome or genuine love? Does it matter if I can't tell the difference?

**Secondary conflict:** How many moral boundaries can I cross before I'm no longer the "good person" I tell myself I am?

**Romance conflict:** I'm in love with a serial killer psychopath vampire who may be incapable of loving me back. Am I enabling a monster, or building something genuine?

**Identity conflict:** Who am I if I'm not the girl trying to escape? If I stay voluntarily, what does that make me?

**Authenticity crisis:** If my feelings originated as survival instinct but evolved into something more, are they less real? Can trauma-bonding become genuine love?

---

## External Conflict

**Series-wide:** Physical captivity (Book 1) → Chosen isolation (Books 2-5), external threats to Gardens, blood supply crises, Vampire Court pressure

**Romance-driven:** Falling for captor creates moral dissonance, Daniel's rescue offer, split consciousness forces choice between two Celestes

**Survival:** Must keep Celeste functional (stable blood supply, research progress) to keep herself safe from Court

**Moral:** Complicity in Celeste's actions (victim disposal, cure experiments on vampires, potential innocent casualties)

---

## Romance Arc Across 5 Books

### Physical Progression
**Book 1:** Touch = threat → Clinical touch (experiments) → First noticing her beauty (fear + fascination)
**Book 2:** Hyper-awareness → Hands brushing → Post-crisis intimacy → First kiss (desperate)

4. **Which Celeste do I want?** Human-Celeste (genuine empathy, unfamiliar) or Vampire-Celeste (obsessive mimicry, familiar)?
