## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### First-Person POV (Mal)

**Characteristics:**
- Observant, detail-oriented (forensic technician)
- Dry humor (coping mechanism)
- Emotionally guarded (trust issues)
- Professional competence emphasized
- Trauma buried (doesn't dwell, moves forward)

**Voice Examples:**
- "The ritual circle was perfect. Too perfect. Mother's work had signature imperfections—deliberate, she'd said, to make the enchantment hold. This copycat had studied, but they'd studied theory, not practice."
- "Rhys Kazemi watched me like I was evidence. I suppose, to him, I was."
- "Jax's eyes were brown. Solid brown. Except when they weren't, just for a second, and then I blinked and they were brown again. Tech migraines, he said. Right."

### Dark Procedural Tone

**Elements:**
- Gritty crime scenes (ritual murders, not sanitized)
- Systemic corruption (Guild, Church, police)
- Paranoia (everyone has secrets)
- Morally gray characters (Oz helps and harms)
- No easy answers

**Avoid:**
- Sappy emotional beats
- Love triangle melodrama
- Chosen One tropes
- Convenient magic solutions
- Simple good vs. evil

### Mundane-Magical Juxtaposition (UFPP Style Guide)

**Technique:**
- Magic intrudes on ordinary routine
- "The coffee was cold. The corpse was positioned in a summoning circle. I drank the coffee anyway."
- Bureaucratic obstacles (Church jurisdiction) matter as much as magical threats
- Technology + magic integrated seamlessly
- Daily life continues despite supernatural
