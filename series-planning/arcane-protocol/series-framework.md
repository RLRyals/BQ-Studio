## Core Premise

In near-future Oakridge, rookie forensic technician Malachite Davies races against time to document crime scenes before Church representatives claim the bodies. As the police department's first mage hire, Davies applies her extensive knowledge of supernatural creatures and magical rituals while rejecting her own magical heritage—a rejection stemming from turning in her mother, a notorious serial killer of unlicensed supernaturals. When a copycat killer begins reproducing her mother's ritual murder methods, federal agent Rhys Kazemi arrives suspecting Davies' involvement. Partnered with Detective Jax Spencer, who secretly harbors his own half-dragon nature, Davies must navigate department politics, Church interference, and her mother's dark legacy while tracking a killer who knows too much about her past.

## World-Building (Focus: Mage Guild)

### Magic System

**Mages:**
- Channel power from Ethereal Dragons to create enchanted objects
- Enchantments carry specific intentions (tracking, protection, destruction, etc.)
- Cannot generate their own magical power
- Must work with Ethereal Dragons or half-dragons to create enchantments

**Ethereal Dragons:**
- Pure magic beings, geographically bound to specific areas
- Can shift dimensions, become incorporeal, take human form
- Don't think like humans; some form emotional attachments to children
- Partner with mages for enchantment work
- Example: Perry Keene (Mal's university professor) - bound to university area

**Half-Dragons:**
- Born from enchantment rituals involving copulation (non-traditional power-building)
- Possess ONE specific ability reflecting mother's enchantment work
- Generate their own power for that one enchantment
- Only affect humans (cannot use abilities on other supernaturals)
- Example: Jax Spencer (truth-compelling ability that changes his eyes to dragon slits)
- Must learn magical control or unconsciously affect humans around them

**Enchanted Objects:**
- Created through ritual with specific intentions
- Power depletes with use until exhausted
- More powerful enchantments require more powerful rituals/sacrifices

### Mage Guild Structure

**Licensing System:**
- Guild controls magical licensing for ALL supernatural beings
- Forces half-dragons into three options:
  1. Work for licensed mages (exploitation)
  2. Hide as human (dangerous - uncontrolled magic affects humans)
  3. Operate in underground economy (illegal)

**Cultural Practices:**
- Mage families abandon half-dragon babies to group homes at birth
- Half-dragons viewed as "mistakes" or "byproducts" of power-building rituals
- ALL mages cremate their dead (avoid Church control of afterlife)
- Ceremonial vs. Non-Traditional divide (sect are ceremonial purists)

**Guild Politics:**
- Council-level leadership
- Digital archives only (no paper - Church information control)
- Some Council members protect/participate in dark sect
- Systematic oppression of half-dragons is legal and normalized

### Dark Sect Ideology

**Core Beliefs:**
- Ceremonial magic purists
- View half-dragons from copulation rituals as "mistakes" and "messes" needing cleanup
- Half-dragons are property or abominations to be controlled/destroyed
- "Cleaning up" escaped/unlicensed half-dragons serves dual purpose: ideology + power

**Methods:**
- Ritual murder of unlicensed/escaped half-dragons
- Harvest victim magic to create powerful enchanted objects
- Operate within Guild structure (protected by some Council members)
- Suicide protocols: brain destruction to avoid Church interrogation

**The Darkness's Legacy:**
- Created magical sword through ritual murders (never recovered)
- Trained others in her techniques (how many?)
- Trained her daughter Malachite for unknown purpose
- Sect wants to complete her work: find sword + recruit/use Mal

### Resurrection Church (Backgrounded - Series 2 Focus)

**Core Functions:**
- Controls all bodies (jurisdiction over crime scenes)
- Preserves pure humans in Field of Souls
- Autopsies supernatural beings (cannot preserve non-humans)
- **Preserved minds can be interviewed** (short window, Church controls technology/access)

**Historical Context:**
- Old Church created Field of Souls as Army of the Dead to destroy mages
- Modern Church runs on tithe (pay-to-play afterlife)
- No mage would willingly enter Field of Souls (risk of conscription)
- Church-Mage conflict deeply rooted

**Body Retrieval Protocols:**
- Church picks up ALL bodies at scenes
- Supposed to identify and notify Guild for mage bodies (for cremation)
- In practice: picks up first, asks questions later
- Creates conflict when mages die (Guild wants immediate cremation)

**Information Control:**
- No mass-produced paper (Church controls all digital information)
- Neural network based on preserved human minds
- Access to historical records requires Church cooperation
- Tithe payments + blackmail buy influence (Oz's method)

**Political Power:**
- Controls who accesses afterlife
- Blocks police investigations through jurisdiction claims
- Sells information access
- Maintains mutually beneficial relationships with criminals (Oz)

### Law Enforcement Structure

**Runners:**
- Specialize in racing Church retrieval teams to document crime scenes
- Time-sensitive work (minutes count)
- Equipped with: AR glasses, drones, magical detection tools (rare)
- Mal is first mage hire in Runner program

**Technology:**
- AR glasses: Standard police equipment, ubiquitous
- AI dispatch: Networked through Church-controlled system
- No paper records: Everything digital
- Private AI: Illegal but exists (Jax has one)
- Migraines from tech: Common supernatural symptom (can't be used as excuse)

**Magical Detection Companions:**
- Flying dog-sized creatures
- Bond for life with handlers
- Detect magical influences at scenes
- Rare police resource
- Example: Officer Gina Chase's companion Whisper

**Federal Involvement:**
- Supernatural crimes cross state lines
- Federal office in Oakridge (Rhys assigned there)
- Access to resources local PD lacks
- Jurisdiction conflicts with Church and Guild

### Underground Economy

**Oz's Network:**
- Protection racket for unlicensed half-dragons
- Provides: fake IDs, safe houses, employment
- Criminal kingpin BUT helps Guild's victims survive
- Church connections through: tithe payments for foster family + blackmail on officials
- Tracks sect activity to protect his clients
- Morally gray: exploitation vs. survival service

**Half-Dragon Community:**
- Distrustful of mages (systemic oppression)
- Some work with Oz's network
- Some try to pass as human (dangerous)
- Some accept Guild licensing (exploitation)
- Underground railroad exists (helping escapees)

## Series-Long Mystery: The Dark Sect

**Central Question:** The Darkness wasn't alone - how many others share her ideology and where does the conspiracy reach?

**Progression Across 5 Books:**

**Book 1:** Copycat killer reveals "The Brethren await" - sect exists
**Book 2:** Historical pattern emerges - 15 years of murders; "Find the Architect"
**Book 3:** Architect identified as Guild Council member; sect structure revealed
**Book 4:** Rite of Ascension plan discovered; requires bloodline magic + sword
**Book 5:** Full conspiracy exposed; sect leadership destroyed but Guild corruption remains

**Key Revelations:**
- Sect operates within Guild structure (protected by Council members)
- Creating arsenal of enchanted weapons for profit + ideology
- The Darkness trained multiple sect members in her techniques
- Mal was being trained for specific ritual purpose
- External funding source (setup for Series 2)

---

## The Sword Thread (Everyone's Quest But Mal's)

**The Darkness's Blade:**
- Enchanted through ritual murder of multiple half-dragons
- Each murder added to its power (extremely dangerous artifact)
- Never recovered after The Darkness's arrest
- Sect views it as weapon + sacred object
- Required for Rite of Ascension (most powerful enchantment)

**Everyone's Obsession:**
- **Rhys (Books 1-2):** Suspects Mal has it or knows location
- **Rhys (Books 3-4):** Realizes her repressed memories contain clues
- **Sect:** Needs blade + Mal (will settle for just blade)
- **Guild:** Wants to secure/destroy (evidence of member involvement)
- **Mal:** Actively avoids thinking about it; focused on current cases

**Mal's Repressed Memories:**
- Protective dissociation from childhood trauma
- Contains information about sword's location
- Everyone pressures her to unlock memories
- She resists until Book 5 (forced by sect's magical coercion)
- Recovery is traumatic, not triumphant
- Location: somewhere mundane, hidden in plain sight

**Resolution (Book 5):**
- Mal recovers sword on her own terms (choosing to face past)
- Uses mother's ritual knowledge to destroy it
- Her agency: not wielding it, ending its legacy
- Rite of Ascension fails without it

---

## Oz Investigation Subplot (Multi-Series Arc)

**The Case:**
- Detectives Simone Driscoll and Eliot Murphy building case against Oz
- Working off-the-books (avoiding his Church connections)
- Moving in shadows to avoid exposure
- Slowly recruiting allies

**Complications:**
- Church actively protects Oz (tithe payments + blackmail)
- Won't cooperate with warrants or evidence requests
- Oz provides services to Church officials (maintains leverage)
- Moral complexity: Oz helps sect victims (half-dragons escaping Guild)

**Progression:**
- Book 1: Seed planted (pattern noticed)
- Book 2: Off-books meetings begin; discover Oz's protection network
- Book 3: Third ally recruited; evidence mounting
- Book 4: Solid evidence but can't move without exposing investigation
- Book 5: Eliot retires; Simone promoted; case unresolved

**Series 2 Setup:**
- Simone runs supernatural crimes taskforce
- Offers Mal detective promotion: condition is reporting on Jax's family connections
- Mal accepts, tells Jax immediately (trusts him over Simone)
- They're partners with surveillance between them
- Oz's help stopping sect complicates prosecution

## Core Themes

### Corruption & Broken Systems
- **Guild:** Systemic oppression of half-dragons through licensing
- **Church:** Pay-to-play afterlife; information monopoly; evidence blocking
- **Police:** Departmental politics; surveillance; disappeared evidence
- **Central Question:** Did Mal trade mage corruption for police corruption?

### Trust & Paranoia
- Trust earned slowly, lost easily
- Everyone has secrets (Mal's past, Jax's nature, Rhys's investigation, Oz's network)
- Professional relationships don't automatically become personal
- Paranoia is sometimes justified in corrupt systems
- Working within broken systems while maintaining personal integrity

### Legacy & Choice
- Cannot escape your past, only choose what to do with it
- Knowledge itself isn't evil; use determines morality
- Mother trained Mal to be a weapon; Mal chooses to be a shield
- Breaking cycles of violence and trauma

### Agency & Autonomy
- Mal's arc: reactive (avoiding past) → active (choosing to face it on her terms)
- Sword quest: everyone's obsession but she solves it when SHE decides
- Romance: slow-burn on her timeline, not external pressure
- Forcing trauma recovery for "greater good" is violation

### Systemic Injustice
- Half-dragons exploited by Guild licensing
- Church controls afterlife access through money
- Law doesn't protect everyone equally
- Some people exist outside legal protection
- Working for justice within unjust systems
