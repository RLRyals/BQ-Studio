2. **Gothic Romantasy** - Rachel Gillig's upcoming release called ["next big romantasy sensation, gothic, mist-cloaked"](https://www.booksaremythirdplace.com/articles/25-anticipated-fantasy-and-romantasy-reads-in-2025)
3. **Monster Romance / Beast Romance** - [Serial killer as romantic hero](https://cmrosens.com/2024/01/03/beauty-and-the-beast-in-gothic-horror-stories/) ("will kill everyone except you") is popular dark romance subtrope

**⭐⭐⭐⭐ VERY HOT:**
5. **Imprisoned Beauty / Trapped in Wonderland** - Caraval's success proves viability
6. **Morally Gray/Dark Protagonists** - Readers want complexity, not pure heroes

---

### READER EXPECTATIONS (Steampunk Gothic Horror Romance)

**✅ MANDATORY Elements:**
- Victorian/Edwardian setting with steam technology (brass, gears, industrial)
- Gothic atmosphere (fog, decay, gaslight, oppressive beauty)
- Atmospheric slow-burn dread escalation
- Romance subplot (slow-burn preferred for this genre)
- Dark secrets revealed gradually
- Morally complex characters (no pure good/evil)
- Beautiful prose with sensory immersion
- Horror elements (body horror, psychological, or supernatural)
- Isolated setting that traps characters
- Victorian propriety creating romantic tension

**✅ EXPECTED Structure:**
- 80,000 - 120,000 words per book (Target: 95,000)
- 20-35 chapters per book
- Standalone OR series (both viable; series more profitable if hooks strong)
- Endings can be tragic, dark-happy, or bittersweet (HEA not required but satisfying resolution IS)

**✅ HEAT LEVEL Options:**
- Sweet to Explicit (Victorian propriety works at any heat level)
- Market supports all heat levels; author's choice

---

### MARKET GAPS & OPPORTUNITIES

**💡 HIGH-VALUE OPPORTUNITIES:**

1. **Wonka Retelling Gap**
   - **Gap:** No major dark Wonka retellings in adult romance space (some YA, nothing adult gothic romance)
   - **Opportunity:** First-mover advantage in specific niche
   - **Risk:** Lower than fairy tale (Wonka less universally known than Cinderella)
   - **Mitigation:** Frame as "mad inventor's wonderland" not explicitly "Wonka retelling" for broader appeal

2. **Beauty-IS-the-Beast + Steampunk**
   - **Gap:** Her Dark Promise doing beauty-as-beast in fantasy, but not steampunk industrial
   - **Opportunity:** Combine trending role-reversal with trending steampunk aesthetic
   - **Unique Angle:** Daughter is the monster, father is the "keeper," protagonist must navigate both

3. **Serial Killer Romance in Historical Setting**
   - **Gap:** Most serial killer romances are contemporary; few in Victorian/steampunk
   - **Opportunity:** Combine "serial killer who won't kill you" trope with Victorian constraints
   - **Unique Angle:** She's locked up not just for being dangerous, but because Victorian society would institutionalize/execute her

4. **Steampunk Gothic Factory Setting**
   - **Gap:** Most steampunk is airships/cities; few factory-as-wonderland settings
   - **Opportunity:** Willy Wonka's factory is iconic; make it gothic and deadly
   - **Unique Angle:** Candy factory becomes torture chamber, whimsy becomes horror

---

### COMMERCIAL VIABILITY ASSESSMENT

**MARKET FIT: 9.0/10** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Genre: Steampunk Gothic Horror Romance (MULTIPLE trending elements)
- Setting: Victorian industrial wonderland (PROVEN with Caraval's Wonderland success)
- Tropes: Dark fairy tale + monster romance + imprisoned beauty (ALL trending)
- Comp Titles: Strong performers (Caraval NYT #1, Kingfisher's gothics, Her Dark Promise recent)

**UNIQUE ANGLE: 8.5/10** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Wonka retelling (relatively fresh in adult romance)
- Beauty-IS-the-beast (trending role reversal)
- Factory-as-wonderland (iconic but underused in romance)
- Steampunk gothic (fusion of two trending aesthetics)
- Father-daughter horror dynamic (uncomfortable, compelling)

**DIFFERENTIATION: 9.0/10** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- NOT another Cinderella/Beauty & Beast/Little Mermaid retelling (oversaturated)
- Unique setting (factory wonderland, not castle/forest/ocean)
- Villain is protagonist (daughter), not antagonist
- Father as tragic villain (trying to "protect" world from daughter, daughter from herself)
- Industrial whimsy meets gothic horror (fresh aesthetic combination)

**RISK FACTORS:**

🟡 **Medium Risk:**
- **Wonka Recognition:** Not as universally beloved as classic fairy tales
  - **Mitigation:** Market as "mad inventor's deadly wonderland" not explicitly Wonka
  - **Benefit:** Wonka fans will recognize and be excited; others see fresh concept

🟡 **Medium Risk:**
- **Serial Killer Protagonist:** Some readers uncomfortable with sympathetic serial killer
  - **Mitigation:** Make her complex, tragic, not glorified (Dexter model)
  - **Benefit:** Dark romance readers specifically seek morally gray/dark protagonists

🟢 **Low Risk:**
- **Steampunk Niche:** Steampunk can be niche
  - **Mitigation:** Emphasize gothic romance, steampunk as aesthetic spice
  - **Benefit:** Steampunk fans are passionate, will champion the series

### TRENDING ELEMENTS IN YOUR CONCEPT

**Already in Your Idea:**
- ✅ Dark fairy tale retelling (Wonka)
- ✅ Victorian Gothic atmosphere
- ✅ Steampunk industrial setting
- ✅ Monster romance (daughter as beast)
- ✅ Imprisoned beauty (daughter locked away)
- ✅ Morally gray characters (father, daughter, presumably protagonist)
- ✅ Factory/industrial wonderland (unique, iconic)
- ✅ Father-daughter dark dynamic

**Recommended Additions:**
- 💡 **Slow-burn romance** (protagonist investigating/entering factory, gradually drawn to daughter)
- 💡 **Mystery structure** (uncovering truth about daughter's killings, factory's purpose, father's experiments)
- 💡 **Victorian propriety as constraint** (protagonist's reputation at risk, scandal if truth revealed)
- 💡 **Steam-powered inventions as horror** (father's machines to contain/control daughter)
- 💡 **Atmospheric escalation** (factory grows more dangerous/alive as protagonist ventures deeper)

---

### RECOMMENDED SERIES STRUCTURE

**5-BOOK SERIES: YES - Highly Recommended**

**Why 5 Books:**
- Complex mythology (father's inventions, daughter's history, factory's secrets) sustains 5 books
- Wonderland/factory has multiple "rooms" to explore (book-per-section structure)
- Character relationships need slow development (daughter trust, father reveal, protagonist growth)
- Serial killer backstory requires time to reveal and complicate
- Multiple victims/mysteries provide book-level plots within series arc

**Escalation Pattern:**
- Book 1: Discover factory, meet daughter, first death
- Book 2: Uncover father's experiments, daughter's history
- Book 3: Protagonist complicit, must choose sides
- Book 4: Factory's true purpose revealed, apocalyptic stakes
- Book 5: Destroy factory or save daughter, impossible choice

---

### READER SATISFACTION PREDICTION: 8.8/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**This Concept Will Satisfy:**
- ✅ Gothic romance fans (atmosphere, slow-burn, dark)
- ✅ Monster romance fans (daughter as beast, morally gray)
- ✅ Steampunk fans (industrial aesthetic, inventions)
- ✅ Dark fairy tale fans (Wonka retelling, twisted whimsy)
- ✅ Horror romance fans (true horror + romance balance)
- ✅ Mystery fans (uncovering secrets, solving murders)
- ✅ Romantasy fans (gothic fantasy elements)

**Potential Complaints:**
- ⚠️ Some readers uncomfortable with serial killer protagonist (niche appeal, but that niche is loyal)
- ⚠️ Dark tone may be too dark for some romance readers (market as horror romance, not pure romance)
- ⚠️ Steampunk aesthetic can be polarizing (but this is gothic-first, steampunk-second)

---
