# PHASE 3: SERIES ARCHITECTURE
## "The Sweetwater Factory Chronicles" - 5-Book Series Plan

**Genre:** Steampunk Gothic Horror Romance
**Target Audience:** Adult readers (18+)
**Heat Level:** Warm to Hot (Victorian propriety creates tension, intimacy earns its progression)
**Violence Level:** High (serial killings, body horror from mechanical transformation, industrial accidents)

---

## SERIES PREMISE

**Elevator Pitch:**
In 1885 London, the legendary Sweetwater Confectionery Factory has been closed for ten years—ever since master inventor Cornelius Sweetwater's daughter vanished and the killings began. When investigative journalist Theodore Grey receives an invitation to tour the factory, he discovers the truth: the factory is a gilded prison, and the Beautiful Monster locked inside is both more dangerous and more tragic than anyone imagined.

**High Concept:**
What if Willy Wonka's factory was built to imprison a serial killer daughter? Gothic horror meets steampunk whimsy in a deadly wonderland where candy kills, clockwork hearts tick with human blood, and the greatest invention is the cage itself.

## OVERARCHING SERIES ARC

### The Central Mystery
**Question:** Why does Vivienne Sweetwater kill, and can she be saved—or must she be destroyed?

**The Truth (Revealed Across 5 Books):**
Cornelius Sweetwater was a genius inventor obsessed with immortality. When his wife died in childbirth, he experimented on their newborn daughter Vivienne, replacing her failing heart with a clockwork mechanism powered by aetheric energy. The procedure saved her life but altered her fundamentally: every seven days, her mechanical heart requires "winding"—not with a key, but with the death of another human. Their life force feeds the mechanism. Without it, she dies.

Horrified but unable to reverse the procedure, Cornelius built the factory as a wonderland prison: beautiful enough to make her captivity bearable, secure enough to protect the world from her, and filled with his desperate attempts to find a cure. For twenty-five years, he's "fed" her heart with carefully selected victims—criminals, the dying, those society wouldn't miss. But Vivienne knows what she is. She's tired of killing. She wants to die.

The factory itself is Cornelius's greatest and most terrible invention: a sentient, mechanical wonderland that evolves, adapts, and protects its prisoner—whether she wants protection or not.

### Series-Level Conflict
- **External:** Theodore must expose the truth about Sweetwater Factory while society (and powerful figures invested in keeping it secret) tries to stop him
- **Internal:** Can Theodore save Vivienne without becoming complicit in murder? Can love exist between someone who must kill to live and someone dedicated to truth?
- **Thematic:** What is the cost of genius? Is immortality (even mechanical) worth the price in human lives? Who gets to decide if a monster deserves mercy?
