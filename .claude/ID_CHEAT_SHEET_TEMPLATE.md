## Purpose

**This document is automatically generated by your Writing Team skills.**

You never need to manually track or look up IDs. This reference is provided for transparency and debugging only. Your Writing Team skills handle all ID resolution automatically - you simply work with human-readable names.

---

## How This Works

1. **Skills Automatically Discover and Cache IDs**
   - When you use skills like `series-planning`, `book-planning`, or `character-planning`, they automatically query the MCP system
   - Discovered IDs are cached in memory for the session
   - Skills maintain their own internal ID mappings

2. **Skills Handle All ID Resolution**
   - You never need to look up or specify IDs manually
   - Skills translate human-readable names to IDs behind the scenes
   - ID management is completely automated

3. **You Work With Human-Readable Names Only**
   - Just say "Book 1" or "the protagonist" or "the magic system"
   - Skills figure out the corresponding IDs automatically
   - No need to remember cryptic ID strings

4. **This Document Shows What the Skills Discovered**
   - Provides visibility into what's in the MCP system
   - Useful for debugging if something seems wrong
   - Updated automatically as skills discover new entities
