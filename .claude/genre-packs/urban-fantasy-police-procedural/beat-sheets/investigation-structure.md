## Overview

**Core Principle:** Every investigation follows a discovery-to-resolution arc with logical progression, setbacks, and earned breakthroughs.

---

## The 9 Investigation Beats

### Beat 1: Discovery / Case Assignment (10-15%)

**What Happens:**
- The crime/supernatural threat is discovered
- Detective/investigator is assigned or chooses to take the case
- Initial assessment of the situation
- Stakes are established

**Procedural Elements:**
- How is the crime discovered? (911 call, patrol discovery, witness report)
- Who has jurisdiction? (precinct assignment, special unit, task force)
- Initial scene response (secure area, call for backup, establish perimeter)
- First impressions and immediate questions

**Urban Fantasy Considerations:**
- Is the supernatural element immediately obvious or hidden?
- Who can detect/recognize magical crime? (special abilities, training, equipment)
- Mundane vs. supernatural law enforcement protocols
- Public knowledge vs. masquerade maintenance

**Character Focus:**
- Protagonist's reaction to the case (professional, personal connection, emotional hook)
- Initial state: routine day interrupted by extraordinary event
- Establishing protagonist's investigative approach and personality

**Scene Types:**
- Crime scene arrival
- Body discovery
- Victim interview (if alive)
- Assignment briefing

**Example:**
> Alex arrives at the warehouse crime scene just after dawn. The uniformed officers look relieved to see her—the victim's eyes are missing, and there's chalk residue on the floor in patterns that make their skin crawl. This isn't standard homicide. This is her jurisdiction: the Supernatural Crimes Unit.

---

### Beat 2: First Lead / Initial Investigation (20-25%)

**What Happens:**
- Crime scene is processed systematically
- Initial evidence gathered and catalogued
- Witness interviews conducted
- First clues emerge pointing toward investigation direction

**Procedural Elements:**
- Crime scene investigation protocols (photography, evidence collection, chain of custody)
- Forensics requests and sample collection
- Witness canvassing (neighbors, first responders, anyone who saw anything)
- Initial theories formed based on evidence
- Database searches, background checks

**Urban Fantasy Considerations:**
- Magical forensics techniques (residue detection, aura reading, trace magic)
- Supernatural witnesses (reliability, credibility, species-specific perception)
- Evidence that requires magical or mundane analysis (or both)
- Jurisdictional cooperation between mundane and magical authorities

**Character Focus:**
- Protagonist's investigative strengths on display
- Partnership dynamics (if buddy cop element)
- Professional competence demonstrated
- Personal reactions to victim or crime

**Scene Types:**
- Crime scene processing
- Evidence analysis
- Witness interviews
- Lab/forensics briefing
- Database research

**Information Reveals:**
- Victim identity and background
- Cause of death or nature of crime
- Initial suspect pool or persons of interest
- Magical signature or supernatural element identification

**Example:**
> The fae blood glows under the blacklight. Alex's phone buzzes—dispatch, again. She silences it and bends closer to the ritual circle chalked on the parking garage floor. "CSI, bag samples from each glyph point," she calls out. "And somebody find me a fae translator before the Council sends their own investigators."

---

### Beat 3: Complication / Red Herring (30-35%)

**What Happens:**
- Investigation hits an obstacle or false lead
- Red herring introduced (convincing but ultimately wrong)
- New information complicates initial theories
- Stakes increase (time pressure, another victim, political pressure)

**Procedural Elements:**
- False leads that seem promising but go nowhere
- Alibis that check out (or don't)
- Evidence that contradicts initial theory
- Witness testimony that doesn't align
- Bureaucratic obstacles (warrants denied, jurisdiction disputes, budget limits)
- Pressure from superiors or media

**Urban Fantasy Considerations:**
- Magical alibis (teleportation, glamour, time manipulation)
- Supernatural witnesses with hidden agendas
- Magical evidence that's difficult to interpret
- Political pressure from supernatural factions
- Conflicts between mundane and magical law

**Character Focus:**
- Frustration and determination
- Professional setbacks test character
- Personal life interrupted by case demands
- Relationship tension (partner disagreement, superior conflict)

**Scene Types:**
- Suspect interrogation that leads nowhere
- Evidence analysis that contradicts expectations
- Departmental politics or internal conflict
- Dead-end investigation sequence

**Example:**
> Three hours of interrogation and the suspect's alibi holds. Worse, the magical signature from the crime scene matches a fae who's been dead for a century. Either someone's using stolen magic—which should be impossible—or the whole investigation is chasing shadows.

---

### Beat 4: Breakthrough / Midpoint Revelation (45-50%)

**What Happens:**
- Major clue discovered that shifts understanding of the case
- False victory or devastating new information
- Investigation direction changes significantly
- True scope or nature of threat becomes clear

**Procedural Elements:**
- Key evidence analysis reveals new information
- Witness comes forward with critical testimony
- Pattern recognition connects disparate clues
- Forensics breakthrough (DNA match, trace evidence, magical signature)
- Informant provides insider information

**Urban Fantasy Considerations:**
- Magical forensics reveal true nature of crime
- Supernatural informant provides crucial context
- Ancient texts or magical research yields answers
- Connection to larger supernatural conspiracy or faction
- Protagonist's powers evolve or are tested

**Character Focus:**
- Moment of insight or realization
- False confidence or crushing revelation
- Character forced to confront difficult truth
- Partnership dynamics shift based on new information

**Scene Types:**
- Lab results breakthrough
- Informant meeting
- Research montage payoff
- Interrogation revelation

**Information Reveals:**
- True motive or larger conspiracy
- Identity of actual perpetrator (or that initial suspect was wrong)
- Connection to series arc or past cases
- Magical mechanism or supernatural explanation

**Example:**
> Alex spreads the autopsy photos across her desk next to the ritual diagrams. The pattern clicks. "These aren't random killings," she says to Marcus. "Someone's assembling components for a resurrection ritual. And we're three victims away from them having everything they need."

---

### Beat 5: Escalation / Rising Stakes (60-65%)

**What Happens:**
- Threat becomes more immediate and dangerous
- Time pressure increases (ticking clock element)
- Another victim or near-miss raises stakes
- Protagonist becomes personally threatened or invested

**Procedural Elements:**
- Active manhunt or surveillance operation
- Tactical planning for confrontation
- Inter-agency coordination
- Protective custody or witness protection
- Race against time to prevent next crime

**Urban Fantasy Considerations:**
- Magical defenses erected or breached
- Supernatural factions choose sides
- Ancient powers awakening or being invoked
- Protagonist's magical abilities tested under pressure
- Hybrid tactics (mundane police work + magical countermeasures)

**Character Focus:**
- Personal stakes escalate (threat to loved ones, moral crisis)
- Sleep deprivation and obsession
- Professional and personal life collision
- Desperation driving risky choices

**Scene Types:**
- Near-miss or failed prevention
- Hostage situation
- Chase sequence
- Tactical deployment
- Personal threat or attack

**Example:**
> The ritual site reeks of ozone and copper. They're too late—another victim, same M.O. But this time the killer got sloppy, left traces. Alex can feel the residual magic singing against her skin. Marcus grabs her arm: "We've got twelve hours before the full moon. That's when they'll complete the ritual."

---

### Beat 6: Dark Moment / Investigation Failure (70-75%)

**What Happens:**
- Investigation approach fails or backfires
- Major setback or loss
- Protagonist makes mistake with consequences
- Appears the case cannot be solved or threat cannot be stopped

**Procedural Elements:**
- Evidence suppressed or ruled inadmissible
- Key witness killed or intimidated
- Warrant denied or operation blown
- Suspect escapes or outmaneuvers investigation
- Internal Affairs investigation or suspension
- Captain removes protagonist from case

**Urban Fantasy Considerations:**
- Magical defenses prove insurmountable
- Supernatural antagonist demonstrates superior power
- Magical community withdraws cooperation
- Ritual or spell successfully completed despite efforts
- Protagonist's powers fail at critical moment

**Character Focus:**
- Self-doubt and despair
- Professional crisis (competence questioned)
- Personal cost realized (relationship damage, physical injury, moral compromise)
- Isolation (abandoned by team, partner, or supernatural allies)
- Lowest emotional point

**Scene Types:**
- Failed operation or ambush
- Confrontation with superior leading to suspension
- Personal loss or betrayal
- Evidence/case falling apart
- Antagonist victory

**Example:**
> The warrant application is denied. Twenty-four hours of surveillance photos, magical trace evidence, witness statements—all circumstantial. The judge won't sign off without mundane proof. And in six hours, the full moon rises. Alex stares at her badge on the captain's desk where she threw it. Breaking into that compound will cost her career. Not breaking in will cost lives.

---

### Beat 7: New Approach / Regrouping (80-85%)

**What Happens:**

**Procedural Elements:**
- Return to crime scene with new questions
- Re-interview witness with different approach
- Unconventional tactics (outside normal procedure)
- Alliance with unlikely source (informant, rival, criminal)
- Pattern recognition from fresh angle
- Going rogue (working off-book to get results)

**Urban Fantasy Considerations:**

- Personal sacrifice or commitment

**Scene Types:**
- Planning session with new strategy
- Risky alliance formation
- Return to evidence with fresh eyes
- Preparation montage
- Moral decision point

**Example:**
> Alex can't use official channels, but the Fae Court owes her a favor. She meets the Liaison in neutral territory at 3 AM. "I need a tracking spell," she says. "Off the books. No paperwork, no Council approval." The fae's smile is sharp. "That will cost you more than favors, Detective. Are you certain?"

---

### Beat 8: Confrontation / Resolution (90-95%)

- Resolution of book-level mystery

**Example:**
> The compound's wards shatter under the combined assault—Alex's iron-laced tactical team from one side, the Fae Court's enforcers from the other. Inside, the resurrection circle glows, nearly complete. The killer stands at the center, hands raised, chanting in a language that hurts to hear. Alex raises her service weapon in one hand, the Court's binding charm in the other. "OCPD! Drop the ritual and step away from the circle!"

---

### Beat 9: Aftermath / Case Wrap-Up (95-100%)

**What Happens:**
- Official case closure and documentation
- Reflection on cost and lessons learned
- Character demonstrates growth from investigation
- Setup for next book or series arc advancement
- Loose ends: some tied up, some deliberately left hanging

**Procedural Elements:**
- Case report filing and documentation
- Evidence logging and trial preparation

Unofficially: the resurrection ritual was the third attempt this year, and someone is supplying forbidden knowledge to amateurs. She tucks the encrypted grimoire into her desk drawer. Tomorrow's problem. Tonight, she sleeps.

- Beat 4: Supernatural informant provides breakthrough
- Beat 5: Magical defenses escalate threat
- Beat 7: Forbidden magic enables new approach

### Balancing Mundane and Magical

**Procedural Authenticity + Fantasy Wonder:**

- Mundane detective work often uncovers magical crimes
- Bureaucracy exists in both mundane and supernatural systems
- Best moments: when ordinary and extraordinary intersect

### Fair Play Mystery Rules

**Reader Must Have Access to Clues:**
- Beat 2: Plant visual or dialogue clues
- Beat 4: Revelation based on previously established information
- Beat 7: Reader could theoretically solve case by this point
- Beat 8: Solution feels earned, not contrived

**Character Knowledge Tracking:**
- What detective knows vs. what reader knows
- Avoid detective making leaps without shown reasoning
- Track when and how information is learned
- Validate deductions are possible with available evidence

- ❌ Departmental politics don't exist

**Magic as Deus Ex Machina:**
- ❌ New magical ability appears exactly when needed
- ❌ Magic has no costs or limitations
- ❌ Magical solution bypasses all investigation work
- ❌ World rules change to serve plot convenience
- ❌ Magical forensics can solve everything instantly

**Character Knowledge Violations:**
- ❌ Character acts on information they don't have
- ❌ Forgot what was learned in previous scene
- ❌ Knows secret they shouldn't know yet
- ❌ Impossible deductions from insufficient evidence
