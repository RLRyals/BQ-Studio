## Genre Pack Principles

### Core Genre Elements

**Urban Fantasy Police Procedural requires:**

1. **Grounded Urban Setting**
   - Real or believable fictional city
   - Contemporary timeframe
   - Mundane world continues alongside magical

2. **Procedural Authenticity**
   - Realistic investigation techniques
   - Police protocols (adapted for supernatural)
   - Departmental politics and bureaucracy
   - Legal framework and jurisdictional issues

3. **Magical World-Building**
   - Consistent magic system with rules and costs
   - Supernatural species/factions with politics
   - Integration of magic into investigation work
   - Masquerade or public magic (defined clearly)

4. **Investigation-Driven Plot**
   - Case structure with discovery → resolution arc
   - Fair-play mystery elements
   - Clues and evidence progression
   - Logical deduction and detective work

5. **Character-Focused Development**
   - Protagonist with detective skills AND character arc
   - Relationships (partnership, romance, found family)
   - Personal stakes in professional cases
   - Growth through investigation challenges

### Critical Balance Points

**Mundane vs. Magical:**
- Magic should enhance, not replace, detective work
- Best moments: supernatural intrudes on ordinary routine
- Procedural grounding prevents "magic solves everything"

**Standalone vs. Serial:**
- Each book has complete case resolution
- Series arc advances without overshadowing case
- New readers can enter series at any book
- Returning readers get payoff for continuity

**Mystery vs. Thriller:**
- Fair-play mystery: Reader can solve alongside detective
- Character knowledge tracking prevents violations
- Clues planted before revelations
- Dramatic irony used intentionally

**Professional vs. Personal:**
- Cases reflect character themes and arcs
- Relationships develop through shared investigations
- Work-life balance creates realistic tension
- Job affects personal life and vice versa

---

## Common Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)

### ❌ Magic as Deus Ex Machina

**Problem:** New magical ability appears exactly when needed to solve case

**Solution:**
- Establish all magical abilities in series planning
- Magic has costs and limitations
- Magical solutions require setup and foreshadowing
- Detective work solves case, not convenient spell

**Reference:** `validation-rules/magic-system-consistency.md`

---

### ❌ Character Knowledge Violations

**Problem:** Detective acts on information they haven't discovered yet

**Solution:**
- Track character knowledge state before every scene
- Log all knowledge gains during writing
- Validate actions match available information
- Use MCP character-planning-server for tracking

**Reference:** `validation-rules/character-knowledge-tracking.md`

---

### ❌ Investigation Logic Failures

**Problem:** Case is solved through coincidence or impossible deductions

**Solution:**
- Plan evidence discovery timing during book planning
- Ensure clues are planted before breakthroughs
- Validate deduction logic (what does character know?)
- Use fair-play mystery structure

**Reference:** `validation-rules/investigation-logic.md`

---

### ❌ Procedural Inauthenticity

**Problem:** Police work feels unrealistic or rules are ignored without consequence

**Solution:**
- Research basic police procedures
- Adapt procedures logically for supernatural context
- Show consequences when rules are broken
- Include bureaucracy and politics
- Consult detective-logan agent for validation

**Reference:** `style-guides/procedural-authenticity.md`

---

### ❌ Info-Dump World-Building

**Problem:** Magic system explained through exposition rather than shown through action

**Solution:**
- Reveal world rules through investigation work
- Use dialogue only for character-known information
- Magical forensics demonstrates magic system
- Supernatural creatures behaving naturally shows society

**Reference:** `style-guides/worldbuilding-integration.md`

---

### ❌ Arc Stalling

**Problem:** Series arc doesn't advance; each book repeats same information

**Solution:**
- Each book must answer at least one series question
- Each book must raise at least one new series question
- Arc antagonist demonstrates new capability
- Protagonist's understanding of arc deepens

**Reference:** `beat-sheets/series-arc-integration.md`
