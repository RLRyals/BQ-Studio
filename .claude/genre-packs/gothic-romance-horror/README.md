## Recommended Workflow

### Series Planning
1. Use `steampunk-setting-template.md` to establish gothic industrial location
2. Use `steampunk-character-template.md` for protagonist and love interest
3. Define the dark secret/curse/threat
4. Establish Victorian social constraints
5. Plan mechanical/supernatural threat and its connection to characters

### Book Planning
1. Choose beat sheet based on emphasis (horror-heavy or investigation-focused)
2. Map character wounds and transformation arcs to beats
3. Plan secret revelation timing
4. Balance romantic escalation with dread escalation
5. Determine ending type (tragic, dark-happy, bittersweet, mechanical immortality)

### Scene Writing
1. Apply three-layer atmosphere technique (Victorian + Industrial + Gothic)
2. Use mechanical metaphors for emotions
3. Build dread through atmospheric escalation
4. Create romantic tension through propriety violations
5. Juxtapose beauty and horror in every scene

### Review & QA
1. Validate romance-horror balance
2. Check Victorian authenticity
3. Verify atmospheric consistency
4. Validate character logic (transformation acceptance, wound-driven behavior)
5. Check secret pacing and revelation impact

## Key Principles

1. **Desire and Dread Are Twins:** The thing she wants is the thing that might destroy her
2. **Three Layers Always:** Every scene should have Victorian propriety + Industrial machinery + Gothic dread
3. **Beauty in Decay:** Romantic moments happen in ruins, love grows in darkness, brass is beautiful but cold
4. **Progress Has a Price:** Innovation built on suffering, technology destroys as it saves
5. **Propriety Creates Tension:** Victorian rules make forbidden proximity irresistible
6. **Transformation Is Inevitable:** Characters change (literally or metaphorically)
7. **Atmosphere Is Character:** Setting isolates, oppresses, and drives plot
8. **Mechanical Metaphors:** Use steam-age technology to describe emotions and relationships
9. **Sensory Immersion:** Sound (steam hiss, gears), smell (oil, decay, roses), touch (cold brass, warm pipes)
10. **Endings Earn Their Darkness:** Tragic, dark-happy, or bittersweet—all valid if earned

## Quick Start

**New to this genre pack?**

1. Read `style-guides/steampunk-gothic-atmosphere.md` first—it explains the core three-layer technique
2. Choose your beat sheet based on your story focus:
   - Horror/atmospheric-heavy → `gothic-romance-structure.md`
   - Investigation/invention-heavy → `steampunk-mystery-romance.md`
3. Use templates to develop your inventor protagonist and gothic-industrial setting
4. Remember: Every scene needs Victorian propriety, industrial machinery, and gothic dread

**Example Opening:**

> The pneumatic post arrived at midnight with a hiss of steam and the smell of ozone. Genevieve wiped oil from her hands—her newest automaton had malfunctioned again, gears grinding where they should mesh smoothly—and broke the wax seal. The letter was brief:
>
> *Miss Blackwood, I require an inventor of discretion and skill. My previous three engineers have failed. Two are dead. Payment: £10,000. Respond immediately. - Lord Ashworth, Thornmere Manor.*
>
> £10,000 would save her father's workshop, pay the creditors, prove that a woman could engineer as well as any man. But two dead. She looked at her reflection in the brass casing of the failed automaton. Dark eyes, oil-smudged cheek, hands that could build miracles but couldn't navigate society's drawing rooms.
>
> She should refuse. A proper lady wouldn't even consider it.
>
> She penned her acceptance before propriety could stop her.
