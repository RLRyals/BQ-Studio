## Usage Notes

This template is designed for comprehensive setting development in steampunk gothic horror romance. The setting should function almost as a character—active, oppressive, and integral to the story.

**For Primary Settings:** Fill extensively
**For Secondary Settings:** Choose relevant sections
**For Atmospheric Locations:** Focus on sensory details and symbolic meaning

The setting should:
- Isolate characters (physically or psychologically)
- Reflect themes (progress vs. humanity, class, knowledge)
- Create atmosphere (dread, beauty, danger)
- Hide and reveal secrets (structure supports plot)
- Transform alongside characters (has its own arc)

Remember: In gothic romance, the setting is never just backdrop. It's pressure, it's prison, it's seduction, it's threat, it's home.
