      "3. Define the dark secret/curse/threat that drives the horror",
      "4. Establish Victorian social constraints that complicate romance",
      "5. Plan mechanical/supernatural threat and how it relates to characters"

    "book_planning": [
      "1. Choose beat sheet: gothic-romance-structure.md for horror-heavy, steampunk-mystery-romance.md for investigation-focused",

      "5. Determine ending type: tragic, dark happy, bittersweet, mechanical immortality"

    "scene_writing": [
      "1. Apply steampunk-gothic-atmosphere.md three-layer technique (Victorian + Industrial + Gothic)",

    "review": [
      "1. Validate romance-horror balance (neither overwhelming the other)",

      "4. Validate character logic (transformation acceptance, wound-driven behavior, period-appropriate)",
      "5. Check secret pacing (reveals timed for maximum impact)"

    "This genre pack emphasizes the unique fusion of three elements: Victorian social constraints, steam-powered industrial progress, and gothic atmospheric horror",
    "Romance is complicated by class divide, propriety, mechanical transformation, and dark secrets",
    "Horror comes from body transformation, industrial danger, supernatural threats, and the cost of progress",
    "Atmosphere is critical—every scene should layer Victorian propriety, industrial machinery, and gothic dread",
    "Endings can range from tragic to dark-happy (mechanical immortality together) to bittersweet",
    "Strong emphasis on sensory detail: sound of steam, smell of oil and decay, touch of cold brass, Victorian formality contrasted with mechanical precision",
    "Character wounds typically relate to loss, transformation, class shame, forbidden knowledge, or family curses",
    "Settings function almost as characters—isolating, oppressive, beautiful, and dangerous"
