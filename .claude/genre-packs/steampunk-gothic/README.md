---

## What This Pack Supports

### Core Elements
- **Isolation**: Physical entrapment, social isolation, psychological claustrophobia
- **Atmospheric Dread**: Victorian setting, steampunk mechanics, decay and beauty intertwined
- **Moral Transgression**: Boundary crossing, complicity, gradual corruption
- **Power Imbalance**: Captor/captive dynamics, monster/victim relationships
- **Psychological Transformation**: Identity crisis, dependency, sanity erosion
- **Beauty in Horror**: Mechanical marvels, intellectual partnerships, wrongness as fascination

### Typical Story Patterns
- Locked-setting narratives (underground lairs, isolated mansions, mechanical wonderlands)
- Cure/salvation quests (seeking redemption through science, magic, or both)
- Slow-burn moral decay (victim becomes accomplice, boundaries erode gradually)
- Intellectual partnerships (captor and captive as collaborators)
- Victorian steampunk aesthetics (gears, steam, pneumatics, gas lamps)
- Series spanning 3-5 books with escalating external threats

---

## Content Ratings

- **Violence**: High (graphic horror, murders, transformation violence)
- **Heat Level**: Warm (ambiguous romantic tension, no explicit scenes)
- **Language**: Moderate (period-appropriate profanity, some strong language)
- **Dark Themes**: Yes (serial murder, moral corruption, psychological horror, captivity)

## NPE Physics Integration

This genre pack includes **custom NPE (Narrative Physics Engine) rules** adapted for Gothic horror:

### Stakes & Pressure Rules (`npe-physics/stakes-pressure.json`)

**Gothic-Specific Stakes**:
- **Dual-layer stakes**: Physical danger + psychological/moral transformation
- **Isolation escalation**: Physical → social → psychological → existential
- **Complicity tracking**: Moral boundary crossings with severity escalation
- **Power dynamic shifts**: 15%+ power balance change per book minimum
- **Cure quest tension**: Incremental progress with mounting costs

**Key Metrics**:
- Boundary crossing frequency: 1 per 8-12 chapters (Book 1), increasing
- Moral compromise severity: Each crossing more severe than last
- Dependency progression: Physical → intellectual → emotional
- External intrusion score: 1-2 (Book 1) → 10 (Book 5)

### Pacing Rules (`npe-physics/pacing-rules.json`)

**Gothic Pacing Philosophy**:
- **Slow burn** punctuated by horror beats
- **60/40 ratio**: 60% atmospheric/character, 40% plot/action
- **Horror beat spacing**: 15-25k words between major horror events
- **Relationship beats**: 1 significant moment every 10-15k words
- **Breathing room**: 3-5k words of processing after major horror beats

**Horror Beat Types**:
- Physical horror (violence, transformation, chase)
- Moral horror (complicity realization, boundary crossing)
- Psychological horror (identity crisis, sanity erosion)
- Existential horror (redemption questions, damnation)
- Atmospheric dread (wrongness, isolation, beauty in decay)
