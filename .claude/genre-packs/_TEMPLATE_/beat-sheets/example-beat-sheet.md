[Continue this pattern for all major beats in your structure]

### Beat 3: [Beat Name] (Chapters X-Y, X-Y%)
[Full beat details...]

### Beat 4: [Beat Name] (Chapters X-Y, X-Y%)
[Full beat details...]

### Beat 5: [Midpoint] (Chapter X, ~50%)

**NOTE:** The midpoint is crucial in most story structures. It's usually around 50% and represents a major shift.

**Target Word Count:** 45-55%
**Estimated Chapter(s):** [Middle chapters]
**Act:** [Act 2]

**Purpose:**
The midpoint is where the story shifts from reactive to proactive (or vice versa). Stakes raise significantly. What seemed to be the story reveals deeper complexity.

**Key Elements:**
- **False Victory or False Defeat:** [Character thinks they're winning/losing but they're wrong]
- **Revelation:** [New information that changes everything]
- **Stakes Increase:** [Why the story matters more now]
- **Point of No Return:** [Why character can't go back to old life]

**Genre-Specific Considerations:**
[How midpoint works in your specific genre]

For example:
- **Romance:** Often the first "I love you" moment or first intimate scene
- **Mystery:** Major clue that reframes the entire investigation
- **Fantasy:** Revelation about protagonist's powers or true nature of quest
- **Thriller:** Twist that raises stakes or reveals larger conspiracy

**Examples:**
[Genre-specific midpoint examples]

**Common Mistakes:**
- Midpoint isn't significant enough (just another plot point)
- Doesn't shift protagonist's approach or understanding
- Stakes don't genuinely raise

**Questions to Answer:**
- What does protagonist learn/realize at midpoint?
- How do stakes increase?
- What changes in protagonist's approach after this?
- How does this tie to theme?

### Beat 6: [Beat Name] (Chapters X-Y, X-Y%)
[Full beat details...]

### Beat 7: [Beat Name] (Chapters X-Y, X-Y%)
[Full beat details...]

### Beat 8: [Dark Night / All Is Lost] (Chapters X-Y, ~75%)

**NOTE:** This is typically the lowest point for the protagonist. Everything seems hopeless.

**Target Word Count:** 70-80%
**Estimated Chapter(s):** [Late Act 2 / Early Act 3]
**Act:** [Usually end of Act 2]

**Purpose:**
Force protagonist to their lowest point so their victory in Act 3 feels earned. This is where they must dig deep and find what they need to succeed (often internal growth).

**Key Elements:**
- **Apparent Failure:** [Protagonist's plan has failed]
- **Loss:** [What they've lost or sacrificed]
- **Isolation:** [Often feels alone or abandoned]
- **Internal Crisis:** [Forced to confront their deepest fear or wound]

**Genre-Specific Considerations:**
[How dark night manifests in your genre]

For example:
- **Romance:** Break-up or relationship seems impossible
- **Mystery:** Sleuth endangered, case seems unsolvable
- **Fantasy:** Mentor dies, power fails, quest appears doomed
- **Thriller:** Protagonist captured, loved one threatened

**Examples:**
[Genre-specific dark night examples]

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not dark enough (must genuinely seem hopeless)
- Too dark (protagonist gives up entirely, loses reader sympathy)
- External only (must have internal dimension)

**Questions to Answer:**
- What has protagonist lost?
- What do they believe about themselves now?
- What must they realize/accept to move forward?
- How does this tie to their character arc?

- **Applied Growth:** [Protagonist uses lessons learned]
- **High Stakes:** [What happens if protagonist fails]
- **Resolution:** [How main conflict resolves]
