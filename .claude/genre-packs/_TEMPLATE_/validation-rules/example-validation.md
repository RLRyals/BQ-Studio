A book can be marketed as [your genre] if it has these REQUIRED elements:

- [ ] **[Required Element 1]:** [Description]
  - Why it matters: [Explanation]
  - How to check: [What to look for]

- [ ] **[Required Element 2]:** [Description]

**If missing ANY required elements:**
This book may not be marketable as [genre]. Consider:

- Is this actually a different genre/subgenre?
- Will readers feel misled if marketed as [genre]?

**Example for Cozy Mystery:**
- [ ] **Amateur Sleuth:** Protagonist is not a professional detective
  - Why: Core to cozy identity, readers expect relatable amateur
  - Check: What's protagonist's day job? Do they have detective training?

- [ ] **Murder Occurs (but not graphically):** Death happens off-page or minimally described
  - Why: Cozy = comfort reading, not horror
  - Check: Is murder scene graphic? Would it upset sensitive readers?

- [ ] **Justice Served:** Murderer caught and will face consequences
  - Why: Cozy readers want satisfaction and moral clarity
  - Check: Does book end with killer captured? No ambiguous justice?

**Example for Romance:**
- [ ] **Romance is THE Plot:** Relationship is primary focus, not subplot
  - Why: Romance genre requires romance-first structure
  - Check: If you removed romance, would story still exist?

- [ ] **HEA or HFN:** Happily Ever After or Happy For Now ending required
  - Why: Genre contract with readers
  - Check: Do protagonists end together and committed?
